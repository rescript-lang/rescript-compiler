`*` means  potential break changes

# 9.1
- Remove depercated APIs Js.Re.exec, Js.Re.test, Node.Fs.on
- #5014 #5063 #5027 the new ReScript CLI interface
Thew new CLI is self explainatory:
```
rescript -h
Available flags
-v, -version  display version number
-h, -help     display help 
Subcommands:
    build    
    clean
    format
    convert
    help
Run rescript subcommand -h for more details,
For example:
    rescript build -h
    rescript format -h
```

- #5025 in place format support, this is subsumed into `rescript format` subcommand
- #5060 #5055
Add formatting support for stdin/sdout
- #5053 #5050 clean up structural object semantics
- #5037 
Allows coercion from nullary types to int/string.
This applies to collections types too
- #5029
int polyvar is compiled into int.
`#0` is the same as 0 except it is structually typed as `#0`
- #5023 generate interface file in rescript syntax by default
- #5021 makes int64 runtime payload small for just comparison
- #5019, #5017, #5016, #5015, #5010 improve error message
- #5008 don't trigger a rebuild if mjs file changes, fix an infinite loop in watch mode
- #5005 not depending on Format for Arg module, smaller size
- #4985 fix the schema of bsb on `dev` property
- #4967 #4986, #4984, #4971, #4972, #4969 Breaking changes
Remove ocaml style classes while structural objects and structural typings are simplified. Js.t is no longer needed. If user does not know
what ocaml style class is, this should not affect him.


# 9.0.2

- #4990 Fix an optimization bug introduced in 9.0

- #4982 pattern match over modules

Provide user with a sugar to pattern match over modules:

```res
let {length, cons} = module(List)
```
More discussions can be found [here](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/introducing-an-extension-to-make-pattern-match-works-on-modules/1196)
# 9.0

- #4933 update syntax bf6561bb5d84
  syntax changes listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#90)
- #4934 generate `@pure` annotations to help esbuild remove more dead code

- #4932 #4931 turn flow syntax checking from a error into warning 103, so it can be turned off as below
```res
@@config({
  flags: ["-w", "-103"],
})

%%raw(`
if (import.meta.hot){
  console.log('es6')
}
`)
```
The rationale is that flow could be not standard compilant so we need provide a work around, here
`import.meta` is something new in Ecmascript

- #4926 #4928 
  *internal* changes, move jscomp/syntax to jscomp/frontend to avoid conflicts

- #4924 #4927 better code generated for pattern match. 
  Take advantage of the JS runtime, some predicates can be simplified

```
"external-stdlib" : "@rescript/std"
```

- #4908 #4919 #4917 #4916 #4914 #4913 #4910
  Get rid of camlp4 as a dev dependency, introduce an optimized visitor pattern
  generator, better performance, no object usage and less dependency thanks to wasm

- #4911 Relax uninterpretable attributes from error to warn to make ppx_deriving happy  

- #4905 *internal* add `Js_exn.anyToExnInternal`

- #4903 porting to open BSD/adJ

- #4902 for stdlib es6 artifacts ship .mjs instead of .js, so that
on the user side, if they config es6 with .mjs, it will work out of box

- #4900 #4986 `'` in string literals does not need to be escaped

- #4893 *internal* simplify numbers in JS IR

- #4892 #4891  *internal* simplify boxed int operations

- #4890 clean up constant in lambda IR, fix a subtle bug when do constant folding

- #4870 fix typo in uncurried error message

- #4867 *internal* clean up bsb_helper

# 8.4.2

- #4864 #4865
  Not install dev directory for pinned dependencies
- #4863
  for a package, only cmi/cmj artifact changes will trigger a rebuild 

# 8.4.1

- Syntax submodule upgrades from 7f5c968 to 7cc70c9
- #4856 #4858
  Improve code generation for pattern match:
  Input:
  ```res
  type t =
    | A 
    | B
    | C 
    | D (int )
    | E (int)

  let f = x => {
    switch x {
        | A => 0
        | B => 1
        | C => 2
        | D (x) => x 
        | E (x) => x + 1
    }
  }    
  ```
  Output was:
  ```js
    function f(x) {
      if (typeof x !== "number") {
        if (x.TAG) {
        return x._0 + 1 | 0;
      } else {
        return x._0;
      }
      
      switch (x) {
        case /* A */0 :
          return 0;
        case /* B */1 :
          return 1;
        case /* C */2 :
          return 2;      
    }
  }
  ```

  Now:
  ```js
  function f(x) {
    if (typeof x !== "number") {
      if (x.TAG === /* D */0) {
        return x._0;
      } else {
        return x._0 + 1 | 0;
      }
    }
    switch (x) {
      case /* A */0 :
          return 0;
      case /* B */1 :
          return 1;
      case /* C */2 :
          return 2;
      
    }
  }
  ```

  tmp > ls -al node_modules/.bin/
  total 96
  drwxr-xr-x  14 hzhang295  staff  476 Sep 20 17:26 .
  drwxr-xr-x   4 hzhang295  staff  136 Sep 20 17:27 ..
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 hzhang295  staff   22 Sep 20 17:26 bsc -> ../bs-platform/bin/bsc
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 hzhang295  staff   25 Sep 20 17:26 bspack -> ../bs-platform/bin/bspack
