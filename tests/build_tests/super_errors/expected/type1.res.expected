  [36m/.../fixtures/type1.res[0m:[2m1:9-10[0m

  [1;31m1[0m [2m│[0m let x = [1;31m2.[0m + 2
  2 [2m│[0m 

  This value has type: [1;31mfloat[0m
  But it's being used with the [1;33m+[0m operator, which works on: [1;33mint[0m

  Floats and ints have their own mathematical operators. This means you cannot add a float and an int without converting between the two.

  Possible solutions:
  - Ensure all values in this calculation has the type [1;33mint[0m. You can convert between floats and ints via [1;33mBelt.Float.toInt[0m and [1;33mBelt.Int.fromFloat[0m.
  - Make [1;33m2.[0m an [1;33mint[0m by removing the dot or explicitly converting to int
  
  You can convert [1;33mfloat[0m to [1;33mint[0m with [1;33mBelt.Float.toInt[0m.
  If this is a literal, try a number without a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20[0m).
