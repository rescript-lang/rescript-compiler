# Rewatch

## [![Release](https://github.com/rolandpeelen/rewatch/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master&event=release)](https://github.com/rolandpeelen/rewatch/actions/workflows/build.yml)

# Info

Rewatch is an alternative build system for the [Rescript Compiler](https://rescript-lang.org/) (which uses a combination of Ninja, OCaml and a Node.js script). It strives to deliver consistent and faster builds in monorepo setups. Bsb doesn't support a watch-mode in a monorepo setup, and when setting up a watcher that runs a global incremental compile it's consistent but very inefficient and thus slow. 

We couldn't find a way to improve this without re-architecting the whole build system. The benefit of having a specialized build system is that it's possible to completely tailor it to ReScript and not being dependent of the constraints of a generic build system like Ninja. This allowed us to have significant performance improvements even in non-monorepo setups (30% to 3x improvements reported).

# Project Status

This project should be considered in beta status. We run it in production at [Walnut](https://github.com/teamwalnut/). We're open to PR's and other contributions to make it 100% stable in the ReScript toolchain.

# Usage

  1. Install the package

  ```
  yarn add @rolandpeelen/rewatch
  ```

  2. Build / Clean / Watch

  ```
  yarn rewatch build
  ```

  ```
  yarn rewatch clean
  ```

  ```
  yarn rewatch watch
  ```

  You can pass in the folder as the second argument where the 'root' `bsconfig.json` lives. If you encounter a 'stale build error', either directly, or after a while, a `clean` may be needed to clean up some old compiler assets.

## Full Options

Find this output by running `yarn rewatch --help`.

```
Usage: rewatch [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [FOLDER]

Arguments:
  [COMMAND]
          Possible values:
          - build: Build using Rewatch
          - watch: Build, then start a watcher
          - clean: Clean the build artifacts

  [FOLDER]
          The relative path to where the main bsconfig.json resides. IE - the root of your project

Options:
  -f, --filter <FILTER>
          Filter allows for a regex to be supplied which will filter the files to be compiled. For instance, to filter out test files for compilation while doing feature work

  -a, --after-build <AFTER_BUILD>
          This allows one to pass an additional command to the watcher, which allows it to run when finished. For instance, to play a sound when done compiling, or to run a test suite. NOTE - You may need to add '--color=always' to your subcommand in case you want to output colour as well

  -n, --no-timing <NO_TIMING>
          [possible values: true, false]

  -c, --create-sourcedirs <CREATE_SOURCEDIRS>
          This creates a source_dirs.json file at the root of the monorepo, which is needed when you want to use Reanalyze
          
          [possible values: true, false]

      --compiler-args <COMPILER_ARGS>
          

      --rescript-version <RESCRIPT_VERSION>
          

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
