(** String operations.

  A string is an immutable data structure that contains a
  fixed-length sequence of (single-byte) characters. Each character
  can be accessed in constant time through its index.

  Given a string [s] of length [l], we can access each of the [l]
  characters of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
  [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
  range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
  characters or at the beginning or end of the string.  We call a
  position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
  (inclusive). Note that the character at index [n] is between
  positions [n] and [n+1].

  Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
  substring of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are
  valid positions in [s].

  OCaml strings used to be modifiable in place, for instance via the
  {!String.set} and {!String.blit} functions described below. This
  usage is deprecated and only possible when the compiler is put in
  "unsafe-string" mode by giving the [-unsafe-string] command-line
  option (which is currently the default for reasons of backward
  compatibility). This is done by making the types [string] and
  [bytes] (see module {!Bytes}) interchangeable so that functions
  expecting byte sequences can also accept strings as arguments and
  modify them.

  All new code should avoid this feature and be compiled with the
  [-safe-string] command-line option to enforce the separation between
  the types [string] and [bytes].

val copy : string -> string [@@ocaml.deprecated]

val map : (char -> char) -> string -> string
(** [String.map f s] applies function [f] in turn to all the
