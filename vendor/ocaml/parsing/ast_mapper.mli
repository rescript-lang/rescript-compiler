(** The interface of a -ppx rewriter

  A -ppx rewriter is a program that accepts a serialized abstract syntax
  tree and outputs another, possibly modified, abstract syntax tree.
  This module encapsulates the interface between the compiler and
  the -ppx rewriters, handling such details as the serialization format,
  forwarding of command-line flags, and storing state.

  {!mapper} allows to implement AST rewriting using open recursion.
  A typical mapper would be based on {!default_mapper}, a deep
  identity mapper, and will fall back on it for handling the syntax it
  does not modify. For example:

  {[
open Asttypes
open Parsetree
open Ast_mapper

let test_mapper argv =
  { default_mapper with
    expr = fun mapper expr ->
      match expr with
      | { pexp_desc = Pexp_extension ({ txt = "test" }, PStr [])} ->
        Ast_helper.Exp.constant (Const_int 42)
      | other -> default_mapper.expr mapper other; }

let () =
  register "ppx_test" test_mapper]}

  This -ppx rewriter, which replaces [[%test]] in expressions with
  the constant [42], can be compiled using
  [ocamlc -o ppx_test -I +compiler-libs ocamlcommon.cma ppx_test.ml].

val register_function: (string -> (string list -> mapper) -> unit) ref

val register: string -> (string list -> mapper) -> unit
(** Apply the [register_function].  The default behavior is to run the
    mapper immediately, taking arguments from the process command
    line.  This is to support a scenario where a mapper is linked as a
    stand-alone executable.

    It is possible to overwrite the [register_function] to define
    "-ppx drivers", which combine several mappers in a single process.
    Typically, a driver starts by defining [register_function] to a
    custom implementation, then lets ppx rewriters (linked statically
    or dynamically) register themselves, and then run all or some of
    them.  It is also possible to have -ppx drivers apply rewriters to
    only specific parts of an AST.

    The first argument to [register] is a symbolic name to be used by
    the ppx driver.  *)
