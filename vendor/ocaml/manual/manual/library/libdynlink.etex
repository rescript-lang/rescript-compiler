The "dynlink" library supports type-safe dynamic loading and linking
of bytecode object files (".cmo" and ".cma" files) in a running
bytecode program, or of native plugins (usually ".cmxs" files) in a
running native program.  Type safety is ensured by limiting the set of
modules from the running program that the loaded object file can
access, and checking that the running program and the loaded object
file have been compiled against the same interfaces for these modules.
In native code, there are also some compatibility checks on the
implementations (to avoid errors with cross-module optimizations); it
might be useful to hide ".cmx" files when building native plugins so
that they remain independent of the implementation of modules in the
main program.

Programs that use the "dynlink" library simply need to link
"dynlink.cma" or "dynlink.cmxa" with their object files and other libraries.
