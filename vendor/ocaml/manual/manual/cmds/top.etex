%HEVEA\cutname{toplevel.html}

This chapter describes the toplevel system for OCaml, that permits
interactive use of the OCaml system
through a read-eval-print loop (REPL). In this mode, the system repeatedly
reads OCaml phrases from the input, then typechecks, compile and
evaluate them, then prints the inferred type and result value, if
any. The system prints a "#" (sharp) prompt before reading each
phrase.

Input to the toplevel can span several lines. It is terminated by @";;"@ (a
double-semicolon). The toplevel input consists in one or several
toplevel phrases, with the following syntax:

\begin{syntax}
toplevel-input:
          {{ definition }} ';;'
        | expr ';;'
        | '#' ident [ directive-argument ] ';;'
;
directive-argument:
          string-literal
        | integer-literal
        | value-path
        | 'true' || 'false'
\end{syntax}

A phrase can consist of a definition, like those found in
implementations of compilation units or in @'struct' \ldots 'end'@
module expressions. The definition can bind value names, type names,
an exception, a module name, or a module type name. The toplevel
system performs the bindings, then prints the types and values (if
any) for the names thus defined.

A phrase may also consist in a value expression
(section~\ref{s:value-expr}). It is simply evaluated
without performing any bindings, and its value is
printed.

Finally, a phrase can also consist in a toplevel directive,
starting with @"#"@ (the sharp sign). These directives control the
behavior of the toplevel; they are listed below in
section~\ref{s:toplevel-directives}.

\begin{unix}
The toplevel system is started by the command "ocaml", as follows:
\begin{alltt}
        ocaml \var{options} \var{objects}                # interactive mode
        ocaml \var{options} \var{objects} \var{scriptfile}        # script mode
\end{alltt}
\var{options} are described below.
\var{objects} are filenames ending in ".cmo" or ".cma"; they are
loaded into the interpreter immediately after \var{options} are set.
\var{scriptfile} is any file name not ending in ".cmo" or ".cma".

If no \var{scriptfile} is given on the command line, the toplevel system
enters interactive mode: phrases are read on standard input, results
are printed on standard output, errors on standard error. End-of-file
on standard input terminates "ocaml" (see also the "#quit" directive
in section~\ref{s:toplevel-directives}).

On start-up (before the first phrase is read), if the file
".ocamlinit" exists in the current directory,
its contents are read as a sequence of OCaml phrases
and executed as per the "#use" directive
described in section~\ref{s:toplevel-directives}.
The evaluation outcode for each phrase are not displayed.
If the current directory does not contain an ".ocamlinit" file, but
the user's home directory (environment variable "HOME") does, the
latter is read and executed as described below.

The toplevel system does not perform line editing, but it can
easily be used in conjunction with an external line editor such as
"ledit", "ocaml2" or "rlwrap"
\begin{latexonly}
(see the Caml Hump "http://caml.inria.fr/humps/index_framed_caml.html").
\end{latexonly}
\begin{htmlonly}
(see the
\ahref{http://caml.inria.fr/humps/index\_framed\_caml.html}{Caml Hump}).
\end{htmlonly}
Another option is to use "ocaml" under Gnu Emacs, which gives the
full editing power of Emacs (command "run-caml" from library "inf-caml").

At any point, the parsing, compilation or evaluation of the current
phrase can be interrupted by pressing "ctrl-C" (or, more precisely,
by sending the "INTR" signal to the "ocaml" process). The toplevel
then immediately returns to the "#" prompt.

If \var{scriptfile} is given on the command-line to "ocaml", the toplevel
system enters script mode: the contents of the file are read as a
sequence of OCaml phrases and executed, as per the "#use"
directive (section~\ref{s:toplevel-directives}). The outcome of the
evaluation is not printed.  On reaching the end of file, the "ocaml"
command exits immediately.  No commands are read from standard input.
"Sys.argv" is transformed, ignoring all OCaml parameters, and
starting with the script file name in "Sys.argv.(0)".

In script mode, the first line of the script is ignored if it starts
with "#!".  Thus, it should be possible to make the script
itself executable and put as first line "#!/usr/local/bin/ocaml",
thus calling the toplevel system automatically when the script is
run.  However, "ocaml" itself is a "#!" script on most installations
of OCaml, and Unix kernels usually do not handle nested "#!"
scripts.  A better solution is to put the following as the first line
of the script:
\begin{verbatim}
        #!/usr/local/bin/ocamlrun /usr/local/bin/ocaml
\end{verbatim}

\end{unix}

\section{Options} \label{s:toplevel-options}

The following command-line options are recognized by the "ocaml" command.
% Configure boolean variables used by the macros in unified-options.etex
\compfalse
\natfalse
\toptrue
% unified-options gathers all options across the native/bytecode
% compilers and toplevel
\input{unified-options.tex}

\begin{unix}
The following environment variables are also consulted:
\begin{options}
\item["OCAMLTOP_UTF_8"] When printing string values, non-ascii bytes
($ {} > "\0x7E" $) are printed as decimal escape sequence if "OCAMLTOP_UTF_8" is
set to false. Otherwise, they are printed unescaped.

\item["TERM"] When printing error messages, the toplevel system
attempts to underline visually the location of the error. It
consults the "TERM" variable to determines the type of output terminal
and look up its capabilities in the terminal database.

\item["HOME"] Directory where the ".ocamlinit" file is searched.
\end{options}
\end{unix}

\section{Toplevel directives}
\label{s:toplevel-directives}

The following directives control the toplevel behavior, load files in
memory, and trace program execution.

{\bf Note:} all directives start with a "#" (sharp) symbol.  This "#"
must be typed before the directive, and must not be confused with the
"#" prompt displayed by the interactive loop.  For instance,
typing "#quit;;" will exit the toplevel loop, but typing "quit;;"
will result in an ``unbound value "quit"'' error.

%
% Remark: this list of options should be kept synchronized with the documentation
% in toplevel/topdirs.ml.
%
\begin{options}
\item[General]
  \begin{options}
  \item["#help;;"]
    Prints a list of all available directives, with corresponding argument type
    if appropriate.
  \item["#quit;;"]
    Exit the toplevel loop and terminate the "ocaml" command.
  \end{options}

\item[Loading codes]
  \begin{options}

  \item["#cd \""\var{dir-name}"\";;"]
    Change the current working directory.

  \item["#directory \""\var{dir-name}"\";;"]
    Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for
    source and compiled files.

  \item["#remove_directory \""\var{dir-name}"\";;"]
    Remove the given directory from the list of directories searched for
    source and compiled files.  Do nothing if the list does not contain
    the given directory.

  \item["#load \""\var{file-name}"\";;"]
    Load in memory a bytecode object file (".cmo" file) or library file
    (".cma" file) produced by the batch compiler "ocamlc".

  \item["#load_rec \""\var{file-name}"\";;"]
    Load in memory a bytecode object file (".cmo" file) or library file
    (".cma" file) produced by the batch compiler "ocamlc".
    When loading an object file that depends on other modules
    which have not been loaded yet, the .cmo files for these modules
    are searched and loaded as well, recursively. The loading order
    is not specified.

  \item["#use \""\var{file-name}"\";;"]
    Read, compile and execute source phrases from the given file.
    This is textual inclusion: phrases are processed just as if
    they were typed on standard input. The reading of the file stops at
    the first error encountered.

  \item["#mod_use \""\var{file-name}"\";;"]
    Similar to "#use" but also wrap the code into a top-level module of the
    same name as capitalized file name without extensions, following
    semantics of the compiler.
  \end{options}

For directives that take file names as arguments, if the given file
name specifies no directory, the file is searched in the following
directories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In script mode, the directory containing the script currently
    executing; in interactive mode, the current working directory.
  \item Directories added with the "#directory" directive.
  \item Directories given on the command line with "-I" options.
  \item The standard library directory.
\end{enumerate}    

\item[Environment queries]
  \begin{options}
  \item["#show_class "\var{class-path}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_class_type "\var{class-path}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_exception "\var{ident}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_module "\var{module-path}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_module_type "\var{modtype-path}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_type "\var{typeconstr}";;"]\vspace{-4.7ex}
  \item["#show_val "\var{value-path}";;"]
    Print the signature of the corresponding component.

  \item["#show "\var{ident}";;"]
    Print the signatures of components with name \var{ident} in all the
    above categories.
    \end{options}

\item[Pretty-printing]
  \begin{options}

  \item["#install_printer "\var{printer-name}";;"]
    This directive registers the function named \var{printer-name} (a
    value path) as a printer for values whose types match the argument
    type of the function. That is, the toplevel loop will call
    \var{printer-name} when it has such a value to print.

    The printing function \var{printer-name} should have type
    @"Format.formatter" "->" @t@ "->" "unit"@, where @@t@@ is the
    type for the values to be printed, and should output its textual
    representation for the value of type @@t@@ on the given formatter,
    using the functions provided by the "Format" library.  For backward
    compatibility, \var{printer-name} can also have type
    @@t@ "->" "unit"@ and should then output on the standard
    formatter, but this usage is deprecated.

  \item["#print_depth "\var{n}";;"]
    Limit the printing of values to a maximal depth of \var{n}.
    The parts of values whose depth exceeds \var{n} are printed as "..."
    (ellipsis).

  \item["#print_length "\var{n}";;"]
    Limit the number of value nodes printed to at most \var{n}.
    Remaining parts of values are printed as "..." (ellipsis).

  \item["#remove_printer "\var{printer-name}";;"]
    Remove the named function from the table of toplevel printers.
\end{options}

\item[Tracing]
  \begin{options}
  \item["#trace "\var{function-name}";;"]
    After executing this directive, all calls to the function named
    \var{function-name} will be ``traced''. That is, the argument and the
    result are displayed for each call, as well as the exceptions escaping
    out of the function, raised either by the function itself or by
    another function it calls. If the function is curried, each argument
    is printed as it is passed to the function.

  \item["#untrace "\var{function-name}";;"]
    Stop tracing the given function.

  \item["#untrace_all;;"]
    Stop tracing all functions traced so far.
  \end{options}

\item[Compiler options]
  \begin{options}
  \item["#labels "\var{bool}";;"]
    Ignore labels in function types if argument is "false", or switch back
    to default behaviour (commuting style) if argument is "true".

  \item["#ppx  \""\var{file-name}"\";;"]
    After parsing, pipe the abstract syntax tree through the preprocessor
    command.

  \item["#principal "\var{bool}";;"]
    If the argument is "true", check information paths during
    type-checking, to make sure that all types are derived in a principal
    way. If the argument is "false", do not check information paths.

  \item["#rectypes;;"]
    Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking. Note: once
    enabled, this option cannot be disabled because that would lead to
    unsoundness of the type system.

  \item["#warn_error \""\var{warning-list}"\";;"]
    Treat as errors the warnings enabled by the argument and as normal
    warnings the warnings disabled by the argument.

  \item["#warnings \""\var{warning-list}"\";;"]
    Enable or disable warnings according to the argument.

  \end{options}

\end{options}

\section{The toplevel and the module system} \label{s:toplevel-modules}

Toplevel phrases can refer to identifiers defined in compilation units
with the same mechanisms as for separately compiled units: either by
using qualified names ("Modulename.localname"), or by using
the "open" construct and unqualified names (see section~\ref{s:names}).

However, before referencing another compilation unit, an
implementation of that unit must be present in memory.
At start-up, the toplevel system contains implementations for all the
modules in the the standard library. Implementations for user modules
can be entered with the "#load" directive described above. Referencing
a unit for which no implementation has been provided
results in the error "Reference to undefined global `...'".

Note that entering "open "\var{Mod} merely accesses the compiled
interface (".cmi" file) for \var{Mod}, but does not load the
implementation of \var{Mod}, and does not cause any error if no
implementation of \var{Mod} has been loaded. The error
``reference to undefined global \var{Mod}'' will occur only when
executing a value or module definition that refers to \var{Mod}.

\section{Common errors}

This section describes and explains the most frequently encountered
error messages.

\begin{options}

\item[Cannot find file \var{filename}]
The named file could not be found in the current directory, nor in the
directories of the search path.

If \var{filename} has the format \var{mod}".cmi", this
means you have referenced the compilation unit \var{mod}, but its
compiled interface could not be found. Fix: compile \var{mod}".mli" or
\var{mod}".ml" first, to create the compiled interface \var{mod}".cmi".

If \var{filename} has the format \var{mod}".cmo", this
means you are trying to load with "#load" a bytecode object file that
does not exist yet. Fix: compile \var{mod}".ml" first.

If your program spans several directories, this error can also appear
because you haven't specified the directories to look into. Fix: use
the "#directory" directive to add the correct directories to the
search path.

\item[This expression has type \nth{t}{1}, but is used with type \nth{t}{2}]
See section~\ref{s:comp-errors}.

\item[Reference to undefined global \var{mod}]
You have neglected to load in memory an implementation for a module
with "#load". See section~\ref{s:toplevel-modules} above.

\end{options}

\section{Building custom toplevel systems: \texttt{ocamlmktop}}

The "ocamlmktop" command builds OCaml toplevels that
contain user code preloaded at start-up.

The "ocamlmktop" command takes as argument a set of ".cmo" and ".cma"
files, and links them with the object files that implement the OCaml toplevel.
The typical use is:
\begin{verbatim}
        ocamlmktop -o mytoplevel foo.cmo bar.cmo gee.cmo
\end{verbatim}
This creates the bytecode file "mytoplevel", containing the OCaml toplevel
system, plus the code from the three ".cmo"
files. This toplevel is directly executable and is started by:
\begin{verbatim}
        ./mytoplevel
\end{verbatim}
This enters a regular toplevel loop, except that the code from
"foo.cmo", "bar.cmo" and "gee.cmo" is already loaded in memory, just as
if you had typed:
\begin{verbatim}
        #load "foo.cmo";;
        #load "bar.cmo";;
        #load "gee.cmo";;
\end{verbatim}
on entrance to the toplevel. The modules "Foo", "Bar" and "Gee" are
not opened, though; you still have to do
\begin{verbatim}
        open Foo;;
\end{verbatim}
yourself, if this is what you wish.

\subsection{Options}

The following command-line options are recognized by "ocamlmktop".

\begin{options}

\item["-cclib" \var{libname}]
Pass the "-l"\var{libname} option to the C linker when linking in
``custom runtime'' mode. See the corresponding option for
"ocamlc", in chapter~\ref{c:camlc}.

\item["-ccopt" \var{option}]
Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker, when linking in
``custom runtime'' mode. See the corresponding option for
"ocamlc", in chapter~\ref{c:camlc}.

\item["-custom"]
Link in ``custom runtime'' mode. See the corresponding option for
"ocamlc", in chapter~\ref{c:camlc}.

\item["-I" \var{directory}]
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for
compiled object code files (".cmo" and ".cma").

\item["-o" \var{exec-file}]
Specify the name of the toplevel file produced by the linker.
The default is "a.out".

\end{options}

\section{The native toplevel: \texttt{ocamlnat}\ (experimental)}

{\bf This section describes a tool that is not yet officially supported %
but may be found useful.}

OCaml code executing in the traditional toplevel system uses the bytecode
interpreter.  When increased performance is required, or for testing
programs that will only execute correctly when compiled to native code,
the {\em native toplevel} may be used instead.

For the majority of installations the native toplevel will not have been
installed along with the rest of the OCaml toolchain.  In such circumstances
it will be necessary to build the OCaml distribution from source.
From the built source tree of the distribution you may use
{\tt make natruntop} to build and execute a native toplevel.  (Alternatively
{\tt make ocamlnat} can be used, which just performs the build step.)

If the {\tt make install} command is run after having built the native
toplevel then the {\tt ocamlnat} program (either from the source or the
installation directory) may be invoked directly rather than using
{\tt make natruntop}.
