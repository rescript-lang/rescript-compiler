% This file describes the native/bytecode compiler and toplevel
% options. Since specific options can exist in only a subset of
% \{toplevel, bytecode compiler, native compiler \} and their description
% might differ across this subset, this file uses macros to adapt the
% description tool by tool:
\long\def\comp#1{\ifcomp#1\else\fi}
% \long is needed for multiparagraph macros
\long\def\nat#1{\ifnat#1\else\fi}
\long\def\top#1{\iftop#1\else\fi}
\long\def\notop#1{\iftop\else#1\fi}
% ( Note that the previous definitions relies on the three boolean values
%   \top, \nat and \comp. The manual section must therefore
%   set these boolean values accordingly.
% )
% The macros (\comp, \nat, \top) adds a supplementary text
% if we are respectively in the (bytecode compiler, native compiler, toplevel)
% section.
% The toplevel options are quite different from the compilers' options.
% It is therefore useful to have also a substractive \notop macro
% that prints its content only outside of the topvel section
%
% For instance, to add an option "-foo" that applies to the native and
% bytecode compiler, one can write
% \notop{\item["-foo"]
%   ...
% }
%
% Similarly, an option "-bar" only available in the native compiler
% can be introduced with
% \nat{\item["-bar"]
%   ...
% }
% These macros can be also used to add information that are only relevant to
% some tools or differ slightly from one tool to another. For instance, we
%  define the following macro for the pairs cma/cmxa cmo/cmxo and ocamlc/ocamlopt
%
\def\cma{\comp{.cma}\nat{.cmxa}}
\def\cmo{\comp{.cmo}\nat{.cmx}}
\def\qcmo{{\machine\cmo}}
\def\qcma{{\machine\cma}}
\def\ocamlx{\comp{ocamlc}\nat{ocamlopt}}

\begin{options}
\notop{%
\item["-a"]
Build a library(\nat{".cmxa" and ".a"/".lib" files}\comp{".cma" file})
with the object files (\nat{".cmx" and ".o"/".obj" files}\comp{ ".cmo" files})
given on the command line, instead of linking them into an executable file.
The name of the library must be set with the "-o" option.

If \comp{"-custom", }"-cclib" or "-ccopt" options are passed on the command
line, these options are stored in the resulting \qcma library. Then,
linking with this library automatically adds back the \comp{"-custom", }
"-cclib" and "-ccopt" options as if they had been provided on the
command line, unless the "-noautolink" option is given.
}%notop

\item["-absname"]
Force error messages to show absolute paths for file names.

\notop{\item["-annot"]
Dump detailed information about the compilation (types, bindings,
tail-calls, etc).  The information for file \var{src}".ml"
is put into file \var{src}".annot".  In case of a type error, dump
all the information inferred by the type-checker before the error.
The \var{src}".annot" file can be used with the emacs commands given in
"emacs/caml-types.el" to display types and other annotations
interactively.

\item["-args" \var{filename}]
Read additional newline-terminated command line arguments from \var{filename}.
\top{It is not possible to pass a \var{scriptfile} via file to the toplevel.

\notop{\item["-bin-annot"]
Dump detailed information about the compilation (types, bindings,
tail-calls, etc) in binary format. The information for file \var{src}".ml"
(resp. \var{src}".mli") is put into file \var{src}".cmt"
(resp. \var{src}".cmti").  In case of a type error, dump
all the information inferred by the type-checker before the error.
The "*.cmt" and "*.cmti" files produced by "-bin-annot" contain
more information and are much more compact than the files produced by
"-annot".
}%notop

\notop{\item["-c"]
Compile only. Suppress the linking phase of the
compilation. Source code files are turned into compiled files, but no
executable file is produced. This option is useful to
compile modules separately.
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-cc" \var{ccomp}]
Use \var{ccomp} as the C linker \nat{called to build the final executable }
\comp{when linking in ``custom runtime'' mode (see the "-custom" option)}

}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-cclib" "-l"\var{libname}]
Pass the "-l"\var{libname} option to the \comp{C} linker
\comp{when linking in ``custom runtime'' mode (see the "-custom" option)}.
This causes the given C library to be linked with the program.
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-ccopt" \var{option}]
Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker.
\comp{When linking in ``custom runtime'' mode, for instance}%

\notop{%
\item["-color" \var{mode}]
Enable or disable colors in compiler messages (especially warnings and errors).
The following modes are supported:
\begin{description}
  \item["auto"] use heuristics to enable colors only if the output supports them (an ANSI-compatible tty terminal);
  \item["always"] enable colors unconditionally;
  \item["never"] disable color output.
\end{description}
The default setting is 'auto', and the current heuristic
checks that the "TERM" environment variable exists and is
not empty or "dumb", and that 'isatty(stderr)' holds.

The environment variable "OCAML_COLOR" is considered if "-color" is not
provided. Its values are auto/always/never as above.
}%notop

\comp{%
\item["-compat-32"]
Check that the generated bytecode executable can run on 32-bit
platforms and signal an error if it cannot. This is useful when
compiling bytecode on a 64-bit machine.
}%comp

\nat{%
\item["-compact"]
Optimize the produced code for space rather than for time. This
results in slightly smaller but slightly slower programs. The default is to
optimize for speed.
}%nat

\item["-config"]
Print the version number of {\machine\ocamlx} and a detailed
summary of its configuration, then exit.

\comp{%
\item["-custom"]
Link in ``custom runtime'' mode. In the default linking mode, the
linker produces bytecode that is intended to be executed with the
shared runtime system, "ocamlrun". In the custom runtime mode, the
linker produces an output file that contains both the runtime system
and the bytecode for the program. The resulting file is larger, but it
can be executed directly, even if the "ocamlrun" command is not
installed. Moreover, the ``custom runtime'' mode enables static
linking of OCaml code with user-defined C functions, as described in
chapter~\ref{c:intf-c}.
\begin{unix}
Never use the "strip" command on executables produced by "ocamlc -custom",
this would remove the bytecode part of the executable.
\end{unix}
\begin{unix}
Security warning: never set the ``setuid'' or ``setgid'' bits on executables
produced by "ocamlc -custom", this would make them vulnerable to attacks.
\end{unix}
}%comp

\notop{%
\item["-depend" \var{ocamldep-args}]
Compute dependencies, as the "ocamldep" command would do. The remaining
arguments are interpreted as if they were given to the "ocamldep" command.
}%notop

\comp{
\item["-dllib" "-l"\var{libname}]
Arrange for the C shared library "dll"\var{libname}".so"
("dll"\var{libname}".dll" under Windows) to be loaded dynamically
by the run-time system "ocamlrun" at program start-up time.
}%comp

\comp{\item["-dllpath" \var{dir}]
Adds the directory \var{dir} to the run-time search path for shared
C libraries.  At link-time, shared libraries are searched in the
standard search path (the one corresponding to the "-I" option).
The "-dllpath" option simply stores \var{dir} in the produced
executable file, where "ocamlrun" can find it and use it as
described in section~\ref{s-ocamlrun-dllpath}.
}%comp

\notop{%
\item["-for-pack" \var{module-path}]
Generate an object file (\qcmo\nat{ and ".o"/".obj" files})
that can later be included
as a sub-module (with the given access path) of a compilation unit
constructed with "-pack".  For instance,
{\machine\ocamlx\ -for-pack\ P\ -c\ A.ml}
will generate {\machine a.\cmo}\nat{ and "a.o" files} that can
later be used with {\machine \ocamlx\ -pack\ -o\ P\cmo\ a\cmo}.
Note: you can still pack a module that was compiled without
"-for-pack" but in this case exceptions will be printed with the wrong
names.
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-g"]
Add debugging information while compiling and linking. This option is
required in order to \comp{be able to debug the program with "ocamldebug"
(see chapter~\ref{c:debugger}), and to} produce stack backtraces when
the program terminates on an uncaught exception (see
section~\ref{ocamlrun-options}).
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-i"]
Cause the compiler to print all defined names (with their inferred
types or their definitions) when compiling an implementation (".ml"
file).  No compiled files (".cmo" and ".cmi" files) are produced.
This can be useful to check the types inferred by the
compiler. Also, since the output follows the syntax of interfaces, it
can help in writing an explicit interface (".mli" file) for a file:
just redirect the standard output of the compiler to a ".mli" file,
and edit that file to remove all declarations of unexported names.
}%notop

\item["-I" \var{directory}]
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for
\nat{compiled interface files (".cmi"), compiled object code files (".cmx"),
and libraries (".cmxa").}
\comp{compiled interface files (".cmi"), compiled object code files ".cmo",
libraries (".cma") and C libraries specified with "-cclib -lxxx".}
\top{source and compiled files.}
By default, the current directory is searched first, then the standard
library directory. Directories added with "-I" are searched after the
current directory, in the order in which they were given on the command line,
but before the standard library directory. See also option "-nostdlib".

If the given directory starts with "+", it is taken relative to the
standard library directory.  For instance, "-I +unix" adds the
subdirectory "unix" of the standard library to the search path.

\top{%
Directories can also be added to the list once
the toplevel is running with the "#directory" directive
(section~\ref{s:toplevel-directives}).
}%top

\top{%
\item["-init" \var{file}]
Load the given file instead of the default initialization file.
The default file is ".ocamlinit" in the current directory if it
exists, otherwise ".ocamlinit" in the user's home directory.
}%top

\notop{%
\item["-impl" \var{filename}]
Compile the file \var{filename} as an implementation file, even if its
extension is not ".ml".
}%notop

\nat{%
\item["-inline" \var{n}]
Set aggressiveness of inlining to \var{n}, where \var{n} is a positive
integer. Specifying "-inline 0" prevents all functions from being
inlined, except those whose body is smaller than the call site. Thus,
inlining causes no expansion in code size. The default aggressiveness,
"-inline 1", allows slightly larger functions to be inlined, resulting
in a slight expansion in code size. Higher values for the "-inline"
option cause larger and larger functions to become candidate for
inlining, but can result in a serious increase in code size.
}%nat

\notop{%
\item["-intf" \var{filename}]
Compile the file \var{filename} as an interface file, even if its
extension is not ".mli".
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-intf-suffix" \var{string}]
Recognize file names ending with \var{string} as interface files
(instead of the default ".mli").
}%\notop

\item["-labels"]
Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in applications,
and labelled parameters can be given in any order.  This is the default.

\notop{%
\item["-linkall"]
Force all modules contained in libraries to be linked in. If this
flag is not given, unreferenced modules are not linked in. When
building a library (option "-a"), setting the "-linkall" option forces all
subsequent links of programs involving that library to link all the
modules contained in the library.  When compiling a module (option
"-c"), setting the "-linkall" option ensures that this module will
always be linked if it is put in a library and this library is linked.
}%notop

\comp{%
\item["-make-runtime"]
Build a custom runtime system (in the file specified by option "-o")
incorporating the C object files and libraries given on the command
line.  This custom runtime system can be used later to execute
bytecode executables produced with the
"ocamlc -use-runtime" \var{runtime-name} option.
See section~\ref{s:custom-runtime} for more information.
}%comp

\notop{%
\item["-no-alias-deps"]
Do not record dependencies for module aliases. See
section~\ref{s:module-alias} for more information.
}%notop

\item["-no-app-funct"]
Deactivates the applicative behaviour of functors. With this option,
each functor application generates new types in its result and
applying the same functor twice to the same argument yields two
incompatible structures.

\item["-noassert"]
Do not compile assertion checks.  Note that the special form
"assert false" is always compiled because it is typed specially.
\notop{This flag has no effect when linking already-compiled files.}

\notop{%
\item["-noautolink"]
When linking \qcma libraries, ignore \comp{"-custom",} "-cclib" and "-ccopt"
options potentially contained in the libraries (if these options were
given when building the libraries).  This can be useful if a library
contains incorrect specifications of C libraries or C options; in this
case, during linking, set "-noautolink" and pass the correct C
libraries and options on the command line.
}%

\nat{%
\item["-nodynlink"]
Allow the compiler to use some optimizations that are valid only for code
that is never dynlinked.
}%nat

\item["-nolabels"]
Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used in
applications, and parameter order becomes strict.

\top{%
\item["-noprompt"]
Do not display any prompt when waiting for input.
}%top

\top{%
\item["-nopromptcont"]
Do not display the secondary prompt when waiting for continuation
lines in multi-line inputs.  This should be used e.g. when running
"ocaml" in an "emacs" window.

\item["-o" \var{exec-file}]
Specify the name of the output file produced by the

default output name is "a.out" under Unix and "camlprog.exe" under
Windows. If the "-a" option is given, specify the name of the library
produced.  If the "-pack" option is given, specify the name of the
packed object file produced.  If the "-output-obj" option is given,
specify the name of the output file produced.
\nat{If the "-shared" option is given, specify the name of plugin
file produced.}
\comp{If the "-c" option is given, specify the name of the object
file produced for the {\em next} source file that appears on the
command line.}
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-opaque"]
When the native compiler compiles an implementation, by default it
produces a ".cmx" file containing information for cross-module
optimization. It also expects ".cmx" files to be present for the
dependencies of the currently compiled source, and uses them for
optimization. Since OCaml 4.03, the compiler will emit a warning if it
is unable to locate the ".cmx" file of one of those dependencies.

The "-opaque" option, available since 4.04, disables cross-module
optimization information for the currently compiled unit. When
compiling ".mli" interface, using "-opaque" marks the compiled ".cmi"
interface so that subsequent compilations of modules that depend on it
will not rely on the corresponding ".cmx" file, nor warn if it is
absent. When the native compiler compiles a ".ml" implementation,
using "-opaque" generates a ".cmx" that does not contain any
cross-module optimization information.

Using this option may degrade the quality of generated code, but it
reduces compilation time, both on clean and incremental
builds. Indeed, with the native compiler, when the implementation of
a compilation unit changes, all the units that depend on it may need
to be recompiled -- because the cross-module information may have
changed. If the compilation unit whose implementation changed was
compiled with "-opaque", no such recompilation needs to occur. This
option can thus be used, for example, to get faster edit-compile-test
feedback loops.
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-open" \var{Module}]
Opens the given module before processing the interface or
implementation files. If several "-open" options are given,
they are processed in order, just as if
the statements "open!" \var{Module1}";;" "..." "open!" \var{ModuleN}";;"
were added at the top of each file.
}%notop

\notop{%
\item["-output-obj"]
Cause the linker to produce a C object file instead of
\comp{a bytecode executable file}\nat{an executable file}.
This is useful to wrap OCaml code as a C library,
callable from any C program. See chapter~\ref{c:intf-c},
section~\ref{s:embedded-code}. The name of the output object file
must be set with the "-o" option.
This option can also be used to produce a \comp{C source file (".c" extension) or
a} compiled shared/dynamic library (".so" extension, ".dll" under Windows).
}%notop

\nat{%
\item["-p"]
Generate extra code to write profile information when the program is
executed.  The profile information can then be examined with the
analysis program "gprof".  (See chapter~\ref{c:profiler} for more
information on profiling.)  The "-p" option must be given both at
compile-time and at link-time.  Linking object files not compiled with
"-p" is possible, but results in less precise profiling.

\begin{unix} See the Unix manual page for "gprof(1)" for more
information about the profiles.

Full support for "gprof" is only available for certain platforms
(currently: Intel x86 32 and 64 bits under Linux, BSD and MacOS X).
On other platforms, the "-p" option will result in a less precise
profile (no call graph information, only a time profile).

\begin{windows}
The "-p" option does not work under Windows.

\nat{%
\item["-pack"]
Build an object file (".cmx" and ".o"/".obj" files) and its associated compiled
interface (".cmi") that combines the ".cmx" object
files given on the command line, making them appear as sub-modules of
the output ".cmx" file.  The name of the output ".cmx" file must be
given with the "-o" option.  For instance,
\begin{verbatim}
        ocamlopt -pack -o P.cmx A.cmx B.cmx C.cmx
\end{verbatim}
generates compiled files "P.cmx", "P.o" and "P.cmi" describing a
compilation unit having three sub-modules "A", "B" and "C",
corresponding to the contents of the object files "A.cmx", "B.cmx" and
"C.cmx".  These contents can be referenced as "P.A", "P.B" and "P.C"
in the remainder of the program.

The ".cmx" object files being combined must have been compiled with
the appropriate "-for-pack" option.  In the example above,
"A.cmx", "B.cmx" and "C.cmx" must have been compiled with
"ocamlopt -for-pack P".

Multiple levels of packing can be achieved by combining "-pack" with
"-for-pack".  Consider the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
        ocamlopt -for-pack P.Q -c A.ml
        ocamlopt -pack -o Q.cmx -for-pack P A.cmx
        ocamlopt -for-pack P -c B.ml
        ocamlopt -pack -o P.cmx Q.cmx B.cmx
\end{verbatim}
The resulting "P.cmx" object file has sub-modules "P.Q", "P.Q.A"
and "P.B".

\item["-pack"]
Build a bytecode object file (".cmo" file) and its associated compiled
interface (".cmi") that combines the object

given with the "-o" option.  For instance,
\begin{verbatim}
        ocamlc -pack -o p.cmo a.cmo b.cmo c.cmo

generates compiled files "p.cmo" and "p.cmi" describing a compilation
unit having three sub-modules "A", "B" and "C", corresponding to the
contents of the object files "a.cmo", "b.cmo" and "c.cmo".  These

\item["-plugin" \var{plugin}]
Dynamically load the code of the given \var{plugin}

the same kind of code as the compiler ({\machine \ocamlx.byte} must load bytecode
plugins, while {\machine \ocamlx.opt} must load native code plugins), and
extension adaptation is done automatically for ".cma" files (to ".cmxs" files
if the compiler is compiled in native code).

\else section~\ref{Ast-underscoremapper}\fi,
implements the external interface of a preprocessor.

\item["-principal"]
Check information path during type-checking, to make sure that all
types are derived in a principal way.  When using labelled arguments
and/or polymorphic methods, this flag is required to ensure future
versions of the compiler will be able to infer types correctly, even
if internal algorithms change.
All programs accepted in "-principal" mode are also accepted in the
default mode with equivalent types, but different binary signatures,
and this may slow down type checking; yet it is a good idea to
use it once before publishing source code.

\item["-rectypes"]
Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking.  By default,
only recursive types where the recursion goes through an object type
are supported.\notop{Note that once you have created an interface using this
flag, you must use it again for all dependencies.}

\item["-runtime-variant" \var{suffix}]
Add the \var{suffix} string to the name of the runtime library used by
the program.  Currently, only one such suffix is supported: "d", and

".lib" files). Building native plugins is only supported for some
operating system. Under some systems (currently,
only Linux AMD 64), all the OCaml code linked in a plugin must have

\item["-safe-string"]
Enforce the separation between types "string" and "bytes",

\item["-short-paths"]
When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the shortest
one when printing the type's name in inferred interfaces and error and

Enable, disable, or mark as fatal the warnings specified by the argument
\var{warning-list}.
Each warning can be {\em enabled} or {\em disabled}, and each warning
can be {\em fatal} or {\em non-fatal}.
If a warning is disabled, it isn't displayed and doesn't affect
compilation in any way (even if it is fatal).  If a warning is
enabled, it is displayed normally by the compiler whenever the source
code triggers it.  If it is enabled and fatal, the compiler will also
stop with an error after displaying it.

The \var{warning-list} argument is a sequence of warning specifiers,
with no separators between them.  A warning specifier is one of the
following:

\begin{options}
\item["+"\var{num}] Enable warning number \var{num}.
\item["-"\var{num}] Disable warning number \var{num}.
\item["@"\var{num}] Enable and mark as fatal warning number \var{num}.
\item["+"\var{num1}..\var{num2}] Enable warnings in the given range.
\item["-"\var{num1}..\var{num2}] Disable warnings in the given range.
\item["@"\var{num1}..\var{num2}] Enable and mark as fatal warnings in
the given range.
\item["+"\var{letter}] Enable the set of warnings corresponding to
\var{letter}. The letter may be uppercase or lowercase.
\item["-"\var{letter}] Disable the set of warnings corresponding to
\var{letter}. The letter may be uppercase or lowercase.
\item["@"\var{letter}] Enable and mark as fatal the set of warnings
corresponding to \var{letter}. The letter may be uppercase or
lowercase.
\item[\var{uppercase-letter}] Enable the set of warnings corresponding
to \var{uppercase-letter}.
\item[\var{lowercase-letter}] Disable the set of warnings corresponding
to \var{lowercase-letter}.
\end{options}

Warning numbers and letters which are out of the range of warnings
that are currently defined are ignored. The warnings are as follows.
\begin{options}
\input{warnings-help.tex}
\end{options}

The default setting is "-w +a-4-6-7-9-27-29-32..42-44-45-48-50-60".
It is displayed by {\machine\ocamlx\ -help}.
Note that warnings 5 and 10 are not always triggered, depending on
the internals of the type checker.


\item["-warn-error" \var{warning-list}]
Mark as fatal the warnings specified in the argument \var{warning-list}.
The compiler will stop with an error when one of these warnings is
emitted. The \var{warning-list} has the same meaning as for
the "-w" option: a "+" sign (or an uppercase letter) marks the
corresponding warnings as fatal, a "-"
sign (or a lowercase letter) turns them back into non-fatal warnings,
and a "@" sign both enables and marks as fatal the corresponding
warnings.

Note: it is not recommended to use warning sets (i.e. letters) as
arguments to "-warn-error"
in production code, because this can break your build when future versions
of OCaml add some new warnings.

The default setting is "-warn-error -a+31" (only warning 31 is fatal).

\item["-warn-help"]
Show the description of all available warning numbers.

\notop{%
\item["-where"]
Print the location of the standard library, then exit.
}%notop

\item["-" \var{file}]
\notop{Process \var{file} as a file name, even if it starts with a dash ("-")
character.}
\top{Use \var{file} as a script file name, even when it starts with a
hyphen (-).}

\item["-help" or "--help"]
Display a short usage summary and exit.

\end{options}
