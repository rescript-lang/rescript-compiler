% LaTeX2HTML Version 0.6.4 : html.sty
%
% This file contains definitions of LaTeX commands which are
% processed in a special way by the translator. 
% For example, there are commands for embedding external hypertext links,
% for cross-references between documents or for including
% raw HTML.
% This file includes the comments.sty file v2.0 by Victor Eijkhout
% In most cases these commands do nothing when processed by LaTeX.

% Modifications:

%  nd = Nikos Drakos <nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk>
%  jz = Jelle van Zeijl <jvzeijl@isou17.estec.esa.nl>

% jz 22-APR-94 - Added support for htmlref
% nd  - Created



% Exit if the style file is already loaded
% (suggested by Lee Shombert <las@potomac.wash.inmet.com>
\ifx \htmlstyloaded\relax \endinput\else\let\htmlstyloaded\relax\fi

%%% LINKS TO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to provide links to arbitrary documents.
% The first argumment should be the text that is going to be
% highlighted and the second argument a URL.
% The hyperlink will appear as a hyperlink in the HTML 
% document and as a footnote in the dvi or ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallinkfoot}[2]{ #1\footnote{#2}} 

% This is an alternative definition of the command above which
% will ignore the URL in the dvi or ps files.
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallink}[2]{ #1 }

% This command takes as argument a URL pointing to an image.
% The image will be embedded in the HTML document but will
% be ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdimg}[1]{ }

%%% CROSS-REFERENCES BETWEEN (LOCAL OR REMOTE) DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to refer to symbolic labels in other Latex 
% documents that have already been processed by the translator.
% The arguments should be:
% #1 : the URL to the directory containing the external document
% #2 : the path to the labels.pl file of the external document.
% If the external document lives on a remote machine then labels.pl 
% must be copied on the local machine.
%
%e.g. \externallabels{http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/WWW/doc/tex2html/latex2html}
%                    {/usr/cblelca/nikos/tmp/labels.pl}
% The arguments are ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externallabels}[2]{ }

% This complements the \externallabels command above. The argument
% should be a label defined in another latex document and will be
% ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externalref}[1]{ }

% Comment.sty   version 2.0, 19 June 1992
% selectively in/exclude pieces of text: the user can define new
% comment versions, and each is controlled separately.
% This style can be used with plain TeX or LaTeX, and probably
% most other packages too.
%
% Examples of use in LaTeX and TeX follow \endinput

%
% Usage: all text included in between
%    \comment ... \endcomment
% or \begin{comment} ... \end{comment}
% is discarded. The closing command should appear on a line
% of its own. No starting spaces, nothing after it.
% This environment should work with arbitrary amounts
% of comment.
%
% Other 'comment' environments are defined by
% and are selected/deselected with
% \includecomment{versiona}
% \excludecoment{versionb}
%
% These environments are used as
% \versiona ... \endversiona
% or \begin{versiona} ... \end{versiona}
% with the closing command again on a line of its own.
%
% Basic approach:
% to comment something out, scoop up  every line in verbatim mode
% as macro argument, then throw it away.
% For inclusions, both the opening and closing comands
% are defined as noop
%
% Changed \next to \html@next to prevent clashes with other sty files
% (mike@emn.fr)
% Changed \html@next to \htmlnext so the \makeatletter and
% \makeatother commands could be removed (they were cuasing other
% style files - changebar.sty - to crash) (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk)

%%% RAW HTML 
% 
% Enclose raw HTML between a \begin{rawhtml} and \end{rawhtml}.
% The html environment ignores its body
%
\excludecomment{rawhtml}

%%% HTML ONLY
%
% Enclose LaTeX constructs which will only appear in the 
% HTML output and will be ignored by LaTeX with 
% \begin{htmlonly} and \end{htmlonly}
%
\excludecomment{htmlonly}

%%% LaTeX ONLY
% Enclose LaTeX constructs which will only appear in the 
% DVI output and will be ignored by latex2html with 
%\begin{latexonly} and \end{latexonly}
%
\newenvironment{latexonly}{}{}

%%% HYPERREF 
% Suggested by Eric M. Carol <eric@ca.utoronto.utcc.enfm>
% Similar to \ref but accepts conditional text. 
% The first argument is HTML text which will become ``hyperized''
% (underlined).
% The second and third arguments are text which will appear only in the paper
% version (DVI file), enclosing the fourth argument which is a reference to a label.
%
%e.g. \hyperref{using the tracer}{using the tracer (see Section}{)}{trace}
% where there is a corresponding \label{trace}
%
\newcommand{\hyperref}[4]{#2\ref{#4}#3}

%%% HTMLREF
% Reference in HTML version only.
% Mix between \htmladdnormallink and \hyperref.
% First arg is text for in both versions, second is label for use in HTML
% version.
\newcommand{\htmlref}[2]{#1}

%%% HTMLIMAGE
% This command can be used inside any environment that is converted
% into an inlined image (eg a "figure" environment) in order to change
% the way the image will be translated. The argument of \htmlimage
% is really a string of options separated by commas ie 
% [scale=<scale factor>],[external],[thumbnail=<reduction factor>
% The scale option allows control over the size of the final image.
% The ``external'' option will cause the image not to be inlined 
% (images are inlined by default). External images will be accessible
% via a hypertext link. 
% The ``thumbnail'' option will cause a small inlined image to be 
% placed in the caption. The size of the thumbnail depends on the
% reduction factor. The use of the ``thumbnail'' option implies
% the ``external'' option.
%
% Example:
% \htmlimage{scale=1.5,external,thumbnail=0.2}
% will cause a small thumbnail image 1/5th of the original size to be
% placed in the final document, pointing to an external image 1.5
% times bigger than the original.
% 
\newcommand{\htmlimage}[1]{}

%%% HTMLADDTONAVIGATION
% This command appends its argument to the buttons in the navigation
% panel. It is ignored by LaTeX.
%
% Example:
% \htmladdtonavigation{\htmladdnormallink
%              {\htmladdimg{http://server/path/to/gif}}
%              {http://server/path}}
\newcommand{\htmladdtonavigation}[1]{}
