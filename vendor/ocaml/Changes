OCaml 4.06.1 (16 Feb 2018):
---------------------------

### Bug fixes

  using extensible variants constructors
  (Luc Maranget, review by Thomas Refis and Gabriel Scherer, report
  by Abdelraouf Ouadjaout and Thibault Suzanne)

- MPR#7702, GPR#1553: refresh raise counts when inlining a function
  (Vincent Laviron, Xavier Clerc, report by Cheng Sun)

  (Jacques Garrigue, report by Jeremy Yallop, review by Thomas Refis)

- MPR#7705, GPR#1558: add missing bounds check in Bigarray.Genarray.nth_dim.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, report by Jeremy Yallop, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- MPR#7713, GPR#1587: Make pattern matching warnings more robust
  to ill-typed columns; this is a backport of GPR#1550 from 4.07+dev

- GPR#1470: Don't commute negation with float comparison
  (Leo White, review by Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1538: Make pattern matching compilation more robust to ill-typed columns
  (Gabriel Scherer and Thomas Refis, review by Luc Maranget)

OCaml 4.06.0 (3 Nov 2017):
--------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

- MPR#6271, MPR#7529, GPR#1249: Support "let open M in ..."
  in class expressions and class type expressions.
  (Alain Frisch, reviews by Thomas Refis and Jacques Garrigue)

- GPR#792: fix limitations of destructive substitutions, by
  allowing "S with type t := type-expr",
  "S with type M.t := type-expr", "S with module M.N := path"
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Jacques Garrigue and Leo White)

* GPR#1064, GPR#1392: extended indexing operators, add a new class of
  user-defined indexing operators, obtained by adding at least
  one operator character after the dot symbol to the standard indexing
  operators: e,g ".%()", ".?[]", ".@{}<-":
    let ( .%() ) = List.nth in [0; 1; 2].%(1)
  After this change, functions or methods with an explicit polymorphic type
  annotation and of which the first argument is optional now requires a space
  between the dot and the question mark,
  e.g. "<f:'a.?opt:int->unit>" must now be written "<f:'a. ?opt:int->unit>".
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Damien Doligez and Gabriel Radanne)

- GPR#1118: Support inherited field in object type expression
    type t = < m : int >
    type u = < n : int; t; k : int >
  (Runhang Li, review by Jeremy Yallop, Leo White, Jacques Garrigue,
   and Florian Angeletti)

* GPR#1232: Support Unicode character escape sequences in string
  literals via the \u{X+} syntax. These escapes are substituted by the
  UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character.
  (Daniel Bünzli, review by Damien Doligez, Alain Frisch, Xavier
  Leroy and Leo White)

- GPR#1247: M.(::) construction for expressions
  and patterns (plus fix printing of (::) in the toplevel)
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Alain Frisch, Gabriel Scherer)

* GPR#1252: The default mode is now safe-string, can be overridden
  at configure time or at compile time.
  (See GPR#1386 below for the configure-time options)
  This breaks the code that uses the 'string' type as mutable
  strings (instead of Bytes.t, introduced by 4.02 in 2014).
  (Damien Doligez)

* GPR#1253: Private extensible variants
  This change breaks code relying on the undocumented ability to export
  extension constructors for abstract type in signature. Briefly,
    module type S = sig
      type t
      type t += A
    end
   must now be written
    module type S = sig
      type t = private ..
      type t += A
   end
  (Leo White, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#1333: turn off warning 40 by default
  (Constructor or label name used out of scope)
  (Leo White)

- GPR#1348: accept anonymous type parameters in `with` constraints:
    S with type _ t = int
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, report by Jeremy Yallop)

### Type system

- MPR#248, GPR#1225: unique names for weak type variables
    # ref [];;
    - : '_weak1 list ref = {contents = []}
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Frédéric Bour, Jacques Garrigue,
   Gabriel Radanne and Gabriel Scherer)

* MPR#6738, MPR#7215, MPR#7231, GPR#556: Add a new check that 'let rec'
  bindings are well formed.
  (Jeremy Yallop, reviews by Stephen Dolan, Gabriel Scherer, Leo
   White, and Damien Doligez)

- GPR#1142: Mark assertions nonexpansive, so that 'assert false'
  can be used as a placeholder for a polymorphic function.
  (Stephen Dolan)

### Standard library:

- MPR#1771, MPR#7309, GPR#1026: Add update to maps. Allows to update a
  binding in a map or create a new binding if the key had no binding
    val update: key -> ('a option -> 'a option) -> 'a t -> 'a t
  (Sébastien Briais, review by Daniel Bünzli, Alain Frisch and
  Gabriel Scherer)

- MPR#7515, GPR#1147: Arg.align now optionally uses the tab character '\t' to
  separate the "unaligned" and "aligned" parts of the documentation string. If
  tab is not present, then space is used as a fallback. Allows to have spaces in
  the unaligned part, which is useful for Tuple options.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Alain Frisch and Gabriel Scherer)

* GPR#615: Format, add symbolic formatters that output symbolic
  pretty-printing items. New fields have been added to the
  formatter_out_functions record, thus this change will break any code building
  such record from scratch.
  When building Format.formatter_out_functions values redefining the out_spaces field,
  "{ fmt_out_funs with out_spaces = f; }" should be replaced by
  "{ fmt_out_funs with out_spaces = f; out_indent = f; }" to maintain the old behavior.
  (Richard Bonichon and Pierre Weis, review by Alain Frisch, original request by
  Spiros Eliopoulos in GPR#506)

* GPR#943: Fixed the divergence of the Pervasives module between the stdlib
  and threads implementations.  In rare circumstances this can change the
  behavior of existing applications: the implementation of Pervasives.close_out
  used when compiling with thread support was inconsistent with the manual.
  It will now not suppress exceptions escaping Pervasives.flush anymore.
  Developers who want the old behavior should use Pervasives.close_out_noerr
  instead.  The stdlib implementation, used by applications not compiled
  with thread support, will now only suppress Sys_error exceptions in
  Pervasives.flush_all.  This should allow exceedingly unlikely assertion
  exceptions to escape, which could help reveal bugs in the standard library.
  (Markus Mottl, review by Hezekiah M. Carty, Jeremie Dimino, Damien Doligez,
  Alain Frisch, Xavier Leroy, Gabriel Scherer and Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1034: List.init : int -> (int -> 'a) -> 'a list
  (Richard Degenne, review by David Allsopp, Thomas Braibant, Florian
  Angeletti, Gabriel Scherer, Nathan Moreau, Alain Frisch)

- GRP#1091 Add the Uchar.{bom,rep} constants.
  (Daniel Bünzli, Alain Frisch)

- GPR#1091: Add Buffer.add_utf_{8,16le,16be}_uchar to encode Uchar.t
  values to the corresponding UTF-X transformation formats in Buffer.t
  values.
  (Daniel Bünzli, review by Damien Doligez, Max Mouratov)

- GPR#1175: Bigarray, add a change_layout function to each Array[N]
  submodules.
  (Florian Angeletti)

* GPR#1306: In the MSVC and Mingw ports, "Sys.rename src dst" no longer fails if
  file "dst" exists, but replaces it with file "src", like in the other ports.
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1314: Format, use the optional width information
  when formatting a boolean: "%8B", "%-8B" for example
  (Xavier Clerc, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- c9cc0f25138ce58e4f4e68c4219afe33e2a9d034: Resurrect tabulation boxes
  in module Format. Rewrite/extend documentation of tabulation boxes.
  (Pierre Weis)

### Other libraries:

- MPR#7564, GPR#1211: Allow forward slashes in the target of symbolic links
  created by Unix.symlink under Windows.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by David Allsopp)

* MPR#7640, GPR#1414: reimplementation of Unix.execvpe to fix issues
  with the 4.05 implementation.  The main issue is that the current
  directory was always searched (last), even if the current directory
  is not listed in the PATH.
  (Xavier Leroy, report by Louis Gesbert and Arseniy Alekseyev,
   review by Ivan Gotovchits)

- GPR#997, GPR#1077: Deprecate Bigarray.*.map_file and add Unix.map_file as a
  first step towards moving Bigarray to the stdlib
  (Jérémie Dimino and Xavier Leroy)

* GPR#1178: remove the Num library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
  It now lives as a separate project https://github.com/ocaml/num
  with an OPAM package called "num".
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1217: Restrict Unix.environment in privileged contexts; add
  Unix.unsafe_environment.
  (Jeremy Yallop, review by Mark Shinwell, Nicolás Ojeda Bär,
  Damien Doligez and Hannes Mehnert)

- GPR#1321: Reimplement Unix.isatty on Windows. It no longer returns true for
  the null device.
  (David Allsopp)

### Compiler user-interface and warnings:

- MPR#7361, GPR#1248: support "ocaml.warning" in all attribute contexts, and
  arrange so that "ocaml.ppwarning" is correctly scoped by surrounding
  "ocaml.warning" attributes
  (Alain Frisch, review by Florian Angeletti and Thomas Refis)

- MPR#7444, GPR#1138: trigger deprecation warning when a "deprecated"
  attribute is hidden by signature coercion
  (Alain Frisch, report by bmillwood, review by Leo White)

- MPR#7472: ensure .cmi files are created atomically,
  to avoid corruption of .cmi files produced simultaneously by a run
  of ocamlc and a run of ocamlopt.
  (Xavier Leroy, from a suggestion by Gerd Stolpmann)

* MPR#7514, GPR#1152: add -dprofile option, similar to -dtimings but
  also displays memory allocation and consumption.
  The corresponding addition of a new compiler-internal
  Profile module may affect some users of
  compilers-libs/ocamlcommon (by creating module conflicts).
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, report by Gabriel Scherer)

- MPR#7620, GPR#1317: Typecore.force_delayed_checks does not run with -i option
  (Jacques Garrigue, report by Jun Furuse)

- MPR#7624: handle warning attributes placed on let bindings
  (Xavier Clerc, report by dinosaure, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#896: "-compat-32" is now taken into account when building .cmo/.cma
  (Hugo Heuzard)

- GPR#948: the compiler now reports warnings-as-errors by prefixing
  them with "Error (warning ..):", instead of "Warning ..:" and
  a trailing "Error: Some fatal warnings were triggered" message.
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#1032: display the output of -dtimings as a hierarchy
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#1114, GPR#1393, GPR#1429: refine the (ocamlc -config) information
  on C compilers: the variables `{bytecode,native}_c_compiler` are deprecated
  (the distinction is now mostly meaningless) in favor of a single
  `c_compiler` variable combined with `ocaml{c,opt}_cflags`
  and `ocaml{c,opt}_cppflags`.
  (Sébastien Hinderer, Jeremy Yallop, Gabriel Scherer, review by
   Adrien Nader and David Allsopp)

* GPR#1189: allow MSVC ports to use -l option in ocamlmklib
  (David Allsopp)

- GPR#1332: fix ocamlc handling of "-output-complete-obj"
  (François Bobot)

- GPR#1336: -thread and -vmthread option information is propagated to
  PPX rewriters.
  (Jun Furuse, review by Alain Frisch)

### Code generation and optimizations:

- MPR#5324, GPR#375: An alternative Linear Scan register allocator for
  ocamlopt, activated with the -linscan command-line flag. This
  allocator represents a trade-off between worse generated code
  performance for higher compilation speed (especially interesting in
  some cases graph coloring is necessarily quadratic).
  (Marcell Fischbach and Benedikt Meurer, adapted by Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review
  by Nicolás Ojeda Bär and Alain Frisch)

- MPR#6927, GPR#988: On macOS, when compiling bytecode stubs, plugins,
  and shared libraries through -output-obj, generate dylibs instead of
  bundles.
  (whitequark)

- MPR#7447, GPR#995: incorrect code generation for nested recursive bindings
  (Leo White and Jeremy Yallop, report by Stephen Dolan)

- MPR#7501, GPR#1089: Consider arrays of length zero as constants
  when using Flambda.
  (Pierre Chambart, review by Mark Shinwell and Leo White)

- MPR#7531, GPR#1162: Erroneous code transformation at partial applications
  (Mark Shinwell)

- MPR#7614, GPR#1313: Ensure that inlining does not depend on the order
  of symbols (flambda)
  (Leo White, Xavier Clerc, report by Alex, review by Gabriel Scherer
  and Pierre Chambart)

- MPR#7616, GPR#1339: don't warn on mutation of zero size blocks.
  (Leo White)

- MPR#7631, GPR#1355: "-linscan" option crashes ocamlopt
  (Xavier Clerc, report by Paul Steckler)

- MPR#7642, GPR#1411: ARM port: wrong register allocation for integer
  multiply on ARMv4 and ARMv5; possible wrong register allocation for
  floating-point multiply and add on VFP and for floating-point
  negation and absolute value on soft FP emulation.
  (Xavier Leroy, report by Stéphane Glondu and Ximin Luo,
   review and additional sightings by Mark Shinwell)

* GPR#659: Remove support for SPARC native code generation
  (Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#850: Optimize away some physical equality
  (Pierre Chambart, review by Mark Shinwell and Leo White)

- GPR#856: Register availability analysis
  (Mark Shinwell, Thomas Refis, review by Pierre Chambart)

- GPR#1143: tweaked several allocation functions in the runtime by
  checking for likely conditions before unlikely ones and eliminating
  some redundant checks.
  (Markus Mottl, review by Alain Frisch, Xavier Leroy, Gabriel Scherer,
  Mark Shinwell and Leo White)

- GPR#1183: compile curried functors to multi-argument functions
  earlier in the compiler pipeline; correctly propagate [@@inline]
  attributes on such functors; mark functor coercion veneers as
  stubs.
  (Mark Shinwell, review by Pierre Chambart and Leo White)

- GPR#1195: Merge functions based on partiality rather than
  Parmatch.irrefutable.
  (Leo White, review by Thomas Refis, Alain Frisch and Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#1215: Improve compilation of short-circuit operators
  (Leo White, review by Frédéric Bour and Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1250: illegal ARM64 assembly code generated for large combined allocations
  (report and initial fix by Steve Walk, review and final fix by Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1271: Don't generate Ialloc instructions for closures that exceed
  Max_young_wosize; instead allocate them on the major heap.  (Related
  to GPR#1250.)
  (Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1294: Add a configure-time option to remove the dynamic float array
  optimization and add a floatarray type to let the user choose when to
  flatten float arrays. Note that float-only records are unchanged: they
  are still optimized by unboxing their fields.
  (Damien Doligez, review by Alain Frisch and Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1304: Mark registers clobbered by PLT stubs as destroyed across
  allocations.
  (Mark Shinwell, Xavier Clerc, report and initial debugging by
  Valentin Gatien-Baron)

- GPR#1323: make sure that frame tables are generated in the data
  section and not in the read-only data section, as was the case
  before in the PPC and System-Z ports.  This avoids relocations in
  the text segment of shared libraries and position-independent
  executables generated by ocamlopt.
  (Xavier Leroy, review by Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1330: when generating dynamically-linkable code on AArch64, always
  reference symbols (even locally-defined ones) through the GOT.
  (Mark Shinwell, review by Xavier Leroy)

### Tools:

- MPR#1956, GPR#973: tools/check-symbol-names checks for globally
  linked names not namespaced with caml_
  (Stephen Dolan)

- MPR#6928, GPR#1103: ocamldoc, do not introduce an empty <h1> in index.html
  when no -title has been provided
  (Pierre Boutillier)

- MPR#7048: ocamldoc, in -latex mode, don't escape Latin-1 accented letters
  (Xavier Leroy, report by Hugo Herbelin)

* MPR#7351: ocamldoc, use semantic tags rather than <br> tags in the html
  backend
  (Florian Angeletti, request and review by Daniel Bünzli )

* MPR#7352, MPR#7353: ocamldoc, better paragraphs in html output
  (Florian Angeletti, request by Daniel Bünzli)

* MPR#7363, GPR#830: ocamldoc, start heading levels at {1 not {2 or {6.
  This change modifies the mapping between ocamldoc heading level and
  html heading level, breaking custom css style for ocamldoc.
  (Florian Angeletti, request and review by Daniel Bünzli)

* MPR#7478, GPR#1037: ocamldoc, do not use as a module preamble documentation
  comments that occur after the first module element. This change may break
  existing documenation. In particular, module preambles must now come before
  any `open` statement.
  (Florian Angeletti, review by David Allsopp and report by Daniel Bünzli)

- MPR#7521, GPR#1159: ocamldoc, end generated latex file with a new line
  (Florian Angeletti)

- MPR#7575, GPR#1219: Switch compilers from -no-keep-locs
  to -keep-locs by default: produced .cmi files will contain locations.
  This provides better error messages. Note that, as a consequence,
  .cmi digests now depend on the file path as given to the compiler.
  (Daniel Bünzli)

- MPR#7610, GPR#1346: caml.el (the Emacs editing mode) was cleaned up
  and made compatible with Emacs 25.
  (Stefan Monnier, Christophe Troestler)

  and module type elements
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Yawar Amin and Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#681, GPR#1426: Introduce ocamltest, a new test driver for the
  OCaml compiler testsuite
  (Sébastien Hinderer, review by Damien Doligez)

  as the handling of ' characters in identifiers.
  (Demi Obenour)

- GPR#1045: ocamldep, add a "-shared" option to generate dependencies
  for native plugin files (i.e. .cmxs files)
  (Florian Angeletti, suggestion by Sébastien Hinderer)

- GPR#1078: add a subcommand "-depend" to "ocamlc" and "ocamlopt",
  to behave as ocamldep. Should be used mostly to replace "ocamldep" in the
  "boot" directory to reduce its size in the future.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#1036: ocamlcmt (tools/read_cmt) is installed, converts .cmt to .annot
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#1180: Add support for recording numbers of direct and indirect
  calls over the lifetime of a program when using Spacetime profiling
  (Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1457, ocamldoc: restore label for exception in the latex backend
  (omitted since 4.04.0)
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Gabriel Scherer)

### Toplevel:

- MPR#7570: remove unusable -plugin option from the toplevel
  (Florian Angeletti)

- GPR#1041: -nostdlib no longer ignored by toplevel.
  (David Allsopp, review by Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1231: improved printing of unicode texts in the toplevel,
  unless OCAMLTOP_UTF_8 is set to false.
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Daniel Bünzli, Xavier Leroy and
   Gabriel Scherer)

### Runtime system:

* MPR#3771, GPR#153, GPR#1200, GPR#1357, GPR#1362, GPR#1363, GPR#1369, GPR#1398,
  GPR#1446, GPR#1448: Unicode support for the Windows runtime.
  (ygrek, Nicolás Ojeda Bär, review by Alain Frisch, David Allsopp, Damien
  Doligez)

* MPR#7594, GPR#1274, GPR#1368: String_val now returns 'const char*', not
  'char*' when -safe-string is enabled at configure time.  New macro Bytes_val
  for accessing bytes values.
  (Jeremy Yallop, reviews by Mark Shinwell and Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#71: The runtime can now be shut down gracefully by means of the new
  caml_shutdown and caml_startup_pooled functions. The new 'c' flag in
  OCAMLRUNPARAM enables shutting the runtime properly on process exit.
  (Max Mouratov, review and discussion by Damien Doligez, Gabriel Scherer,
  Mark Shinwell, Thomas Braibant, Stephen Dolan, Pierre Chambart,
  François Bobot, Jacques Garrigue, David Allsopp, and Alain Frisch)

- GPR#938, GPR#1170, GPR#1289: Stack overflow detection on 64-bit Windows
  (Olivier Andrieu, tweaked by David Allsopp)

- GPR#1070, GPR#1295: enable gcc typechecking for caml_alloc_sprintf,
  caml_gc_message. Make caml_gc_message a variadic function. Fix many
  caml_gc_message format strings.
  (Olivier Andrieu, review and 32bit fix by David Allsopp)

- GPR#1073: Remove statically allocated compare stack.
  (Stephen Dolan)

- GPR#1086: in Sys.getcwd, just fail instead of calling getwd()
  if HAS_GETCWD is not set.
  (Report and first fix by Sebastian Markbåge, final fix by Xavier Leroy,
   review by Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1269: Remove 50ms delay at exit for programs using threads
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Stephen Dolan)

* GPR#1309: open files with O_CLOEXEC (or equivalent) in caml_sys_open, thus
  unifying the semantics between Unix and Windows and also eliminating race
  condition on Unix.
  (David Allsopp, report by Andreas Hauptmann)

- GPR#1326: Enable use of CFI directives in AArch64 and ARM runtime
  systems' assembly code (asmrun/arm64.S).  Add CFI directives to enable
  unwinding through [caml_c_call] and [caml_call_gc] with correct termination
  of unwinding at [main].
  (Mark Shinwell, review by Xavier Leroy and Gabriel Scherer, with thanks
  to Daniel Bünzli and Fu Yong Quah for testing)

- GPR#1338: Add "-g" for bytecode runtime system compilation
  (Mark Shinwell)

  (Mark Shinwell, report by John Whitington, review by Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#558: enable shared library and natdynlink support on more Linux
  platforms
  (Felix Janda, Mark Shinwell)

* GPR#1104: remove support for the NeXTStep platform
  (Sébastien Hinderer)

- GPR#1130: enable detection of IBM XL C compiler (one need to run configure
  with "-cc <path to xlc compiler>"). Enable shared library support for
  bytecode executables on AIX/xlc (tested on AIX 7.1, XL C 12).
  To enable 64-bit, run both "configure" and "make world" with OBJECT_MODE=64.
  (Konstantin Romanov, Enrique Naudon)

- GPR#1203: speed up the manual build by using ocamldoc.opt
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Florian Angeletti)

- GPR#1214: harden config/Makefile against '#' characters in PREFIX

  (Leo White, review by Mark Shinwell)

* GPR#1242: disable C plugins loading by default
  (Alexey Egorov)

- GPR#1275: correct configure test for Spacetime availability
  (Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#1278: discover presence of <sys/shm.h> during configure for afl runtime
  (Hannes Mehnert)

- GPR#1386: provide configure-time options to fine-tune the safe-string
  options and default settings changed by GPR#1525.

  The previous configure option -safe-string is now
  renamed -force-safe-string.

  At configure-time, -force-safe-string forces all module to use
  immutable strings (this disables the per-file, compile-time
  -unsafe-string option). The new default-(un)safe-string options
  let you set the default choice for the per-file compile-time
  option. (The new GPR#1252 behavior corresponds to having
  -default-safe-string, while 4.05 and older had
  -default-unsafe-string).

- GPR#1409: Fix to enable NetBSD/powerpc to work.
  (Håvard Eidnes)

### Internal/compiler-libs changes:

- MPR#6826, GPR#828, GPR#834: improve compilation time for open
  (Alain Frisch, review by Frédéric Bour and Jacques Garrigue)

- MPR#7127, GPR#454, GPR#1058: in toplevel, print bytes and strip
  strings longer than the size specified by the "print_length" directive

  (Albin Coquereau)

* GPR#1127: move config/{m,s}.h to byterun/caml and install them.
  User code should not have to include them directly since they are
  included by other header files.
  Previously {m,s}.h were not installed but they were substituted into
  caml/config.h; they are now just #include-d by this file. This may
  break some scripts relying on the (unspecified) presence of certain
  #define in config.h instead of m.h and s.h -- they can be rewritten
  to try to grep those files if they exist.

OCaml 4.05.0 (13 Jul 2017):
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

### Code generation and optimizations:

- MPR#7201, GPR#954: Correct wrong optimisation of "0 / <expr>"
  and "0 mod <expr>" in the case when <expr> was a non-constant
  evaluating to zero
  (Mark Shinwell, review by Gabriel Scherer, Leo White and Xavier Leroy)

- MPR#7357, GPR#832: Improve compilation time for toplevel
  include(struct ... end : sig ... end)
  (Alain Frisch, report by Hongbo Zhang, review by Jacques Garrigue)

  Shinwell, Gabriel Scherer and Damien Doligez)

- GPR#863, GPR#1068, GPR#1069: Optimise matches with constant
  results to lookup tables.
  (Stephen Dolan, review by Gabriel Scherer, Pierre Chambart,
  Mark Shinwell, and bug report by Gabriel Scherer)

  (KC Sivaramakrishnan)

### Runtime system:

- MPR#385, GPR#953: Add caml_startup_exn
  (Mark Shinwell)

- MPR#7423, GPR#946: expose new exception-raising functions
  `void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}_value(value msg)`
  in addition to
  `void caml_{failwith,invalid_argument}(char const *msg)`.
  The previous functions would not free their message argument, so
  were inconvient for dynamically-allocated messages; the messages
  passed to the new functions are handled by the garbage collector.
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Mark Shinwell, request by Immanuel Litzroth)

- MPR#7557, GPR#1213: More security for getenv
  (Damien Doligez, reports by Seth Arnold and Eric Milliken, review by
  Xavier Leroy, David Allsopp, Stephen Dolan, Hannes Mehnert)

- GPR#795: remove 256-character limitation on Sys.executable_name
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#891: Use -fno-builtin-memcmp when building runtime with gcc.
  (Leo White)

### Type system:

- MPR#6608, GPR#901: unify record types when overriding all fields
  (Tadeu Zagallo and Gabriel Scherer, report by Jeremy Yallop,
  review by David Allsopp, Jacques Garrigue)

* MPR#7414, GPR#929: Soundness bug with non-generalized type variables and
  functors.
  (compatibility: some code using module-global mutable state will
   fail at compile-time and is fixed by adding extra annotations;
   see the Mantis and Github discussions.)
  (Jacques Garrigue, report by Leo White)

### Compiler user-interface and warnings:

- MPR#7050, GPR#748 GPR#843 GPR#864: new `-args/-args0 <file>` parameters to
  provide extra command-line arguments in a file -- see documentation.
  User programs may implement similar options using the new `Expand`
  constructor of the `Arg` module.
  (Bernhard Schommer, review by Jérémie Dimino, Gabriel Scherer
   and Damien Doligez, discussion with Alain Frisch and Xavier Leroy,
   feature request from the Coq team)

  Windows
  (Jonathan Protzenko)

- MPR#7479: make sure "ocamlc -pack" is only given .cmo and .cmi files,
  and that "ocamlopt -pack" is only given .cmx and .cmi files.
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#796: allow compiler plugins to declare their own arguments.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#829: better error when opening a module aliased to a functor
  (Alain Frisch)

- GPR#911: ocamlc/ocamlopt do not pass warnings-related options to C
  compiler when called to compile third-party C source files
  (Sébastien Hinderer, review by Adrien Nader and David Allsopp)

- GPR#915: fix -dsource (pprintast.ml) bugs
  (Runhang Li, review by Alain Frisch)

* GPR#933: ocamlopt -p now reports an error on platforms that do not
  support profiling with gprof; dummy profiling libraries are no longer
  installed on such platforms.
  This can be tested with ocamlopt -config
  (Sébastien Hinderer)

- GPR#1009: "ocamlc -c -linkall" and "ocamlopt -c -linkall" can now be used
  to set the "always link" flag on individual compilation units.  This
  controls linking with finer granularity than "-a -linkall", which sets
  the "always link" flag on all units of the given library.
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#1015: add option "-plugin PLUGIN" to ocamldep too. Use compilerlibs
  to build ocamldep. Add option "-depend" to ocamlc/ocamlopt to behave
  as ocamldep. Remove any use of ocamldep to build the distribution.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#1027: various improvements to -dtimings, mostly including time
  spent in subprocesses like preprocessors
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#1098: the compiler now takes the boolean "OCAML_COLOR" environment
  variable into account if "-color" is not provided.  This allows users
  to override the default behaviour without modifying invocations of ocaml
  manually.
  (Hannes Mehnert, Guillaume Bury,
   review by Daniel Bünzli, Gabriel Scherer, Damien Doligez)

  in StringLabels and BytesLabels.
  (Roma Sokolov, review by Gabriel Scherer, Jacques Garrigue,
   Gabriel Radanne, Alain Frisch)

- GPR#999: Arg, do not repeat the usage message thrice when reporting an error
  (this was a regression in 4.03)
  (Florian Angeletti, review by Gabriel Scherer)

  Unix.create_process{,_env} under Windows.  Arguments with tabs should now
  be received verbatim by the child process.
  (Nicolás Ojeda Bär, Andreas Hauptmann review by Xavier Leroy)

### Debugging and profiling:

- MPR#7258: ocamldebug's "install_printer" command had problems with
  module aliases
  (Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#378: Add [Printexc.raise_with_backtrace] to raise an exception using
  an explicit backtrace
  (François Bobot, review by Gabriel Scherer, Xavier Leroy, Damien Doligez,

  inspired by John Whitington)

- GPR#916: new tool lintapidiff, use it to update the manual with

  (Edwin Török, review by Gabriel Scherer, discussion with Alain Frisch,
   David Allsopp, Sébastien Hinderer, Damien Doligez and Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#939: activate the caml_example environment in the language
  extensions section of the manual. Convert some existing code
  examples to this format.
  (Florian Angeletti)

- GPR#1082: clarify that the use of quoted string for preprocessed
  foreign quotations still requires the use of an extension node
  [%foo ...] to mark non-standard interpretation.
  (Gabriel Scherer, request by Matthew Wahab in GPR#1066,
   review by Florian Angeletti)

  The fix is to no longer consider mutexes and condition variables
  as rare kernel resources.

- GPR#650: in the Unix library, add `?cloexec:bool` optional arguments to
  functions that create file descriptors (`dup`, `dup2`, `pipe`, `socket`,
  `socketpair`, `accept`).  Implement these optional arguments in the
  most atomic manner provided by the operating system to set (or clear)
  the close-on-exec flag at the same time the file descriptor is created,
  reducing the risk of race conditions with `exec` or `create_process`
  calls running in other threads, and improving security.  Also: add a
  `O_KEEPEXEC` flag for `openfile` by symmetry with `O_CLOEXEC`.
  (Xavier Leroy, review by Mark Shinwell, David Allsopp and Alain Frisch,
   request by Romain Beauxis)

- GPR#996: correctly update caml_top_of_stack in systhreads
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- GPR#997, GPR#1077: Deprecate Bigarray.*.map_file and add Unix.map_file as a

### Compiler distribution build system: Makefile factorization

The compiler distribution build system (the set of Makefiles used to
build the compiler distribution) traditionally had separate Makefiles
for Unix and Windows, which lead to some amount of duplication and
subtle differences and technical debt in general -- for people working
on the compiler distribution, but also cross-compilation or porting to
new systems. During the 4.05 development period, Sébastien Hinderer
worked on harmonizing the build rules and merging the two build
systems.

* Some changes were made to the config/Makefile file which
  is exported as $(ocamlc -where)/Makefile.config, and on
  which some advanced users might rely. The changes are
  as follows:
  - a BYTERUN variable was added that points to the installed ocamlrun
  - the PARTIALLD variable was removed (PACKLD is more complete)
  - the always-empty DLLCCCOMPOPTS was removed
  - the SHARED variable was removed; its value is "shared" or "noshared",
    which duplicates the existing and more convenient
    SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBRARIES variable whose value is "true" or "false".

  Note that Makefile.config may change further in the future and relying
  on it is a bit fragile. We plan to make `ocamlc -config` easier to use
  for scripting purposes, and have a stable interface there. If you rely
  on Makefile.config, you may want to get in touch with Sébastien Hinderer
  or participate to MPR#7116 (Allow easy retrieval of Makefile.config's values)
  or MPR#7172 (More information in ocamlc -config).

The complete list of changes is listed below.

- GPR#705: update Makefile.nt so that ocamlnat compiles
  for non-Cygwin Windows ports.

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

- PR#7233: Support GADT equations on non-local abstract types
  (Jacques Garrigue)

- GPR#187, GPR#578: Local opening of modules in a pattern.
  Syntax: "M.(p)", "M.[p]","M.[| p |]", "M.{p}"
  (Florian Angeletti, Jacques Garrigue, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#301: local exception declarations "let exception ... in"
  (Alain Frisch)

- GPR#508: Allow shortcut for extension on semicolons: ;%foo
  (Jérémie Dimino)

- GPR#606: optimized representation for immutable records with a single
  field, and concrete types with a single constructor with a single argument.
  This is triggered with a [@@unboxed] attribute on the type definition.
  Currently mutually recursive datatypes are not well supported, this
  limitation should be lifted in the future (see MPR#7364).
  (Damien Doligez)

### Compiler user-interface and warnings:

* PR#6475, GPR#464: interpret all command-line options before compiling any
  files, changes (improves) the semantics of repeated -o options or -o
  combined with -c see the super-detailed commit message at
  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/da56cf6dfdc13c09905c2e07f1d4849c8346eec8

  files with -a, -pack, -shared; (ii) use "before" objects in the toplevel
  (but not "after" objects); (iii) use -I dirs in the toplevel,
  (iv) fix bug where -I dirs were ignored when using threads
  (Marc Lasson, review by Damien Doligez and Alain Frisch)

  to switch bigarrays between C and fortran layouts.
  (Guillaume Hennequin, review by Florian Angeletti)

### Code generation and optimizations:

- PR#4747, GPR#328: Optimize Hashtbl by using in-place updates of its
  internal bucket lists.  All operations run in constant stack size
  and are usually faster, except Hashtbl.copy which can be much
  slower
  (Alain Frisch)

- PR#6217, GPR#538: Optimize performance of record update:
  no more performance cliff when { foo with t1 = ..; t2 = ...; ... }
  hits 6 updated fields

  C external.  This should be faster.
  (Demi Obenour)

### Runtime system:

- PR#7203, GPR#534: Add a new primitive caml_alloc_float_array to allocate an
  array of floats
  (Thomas Braibant)

- PR#7210, GPR#562: Allows to register finalisation function that are
  called only when a value will never be reachable anymore. The
  drawbacks compared to the existing one is that the finalisation
  function is not called with the value as argument. These finalisers
  are registered with `GC.finalise_last`
  (François Bobot reviewed by Damien Doligez and Leo White)

- GPR#247: In previous OCaml versions, inlining caused stack frames to
  disappear from stacktraces. This made debugging harder in presence of
  optimizations, and flambda was going to make this worse. The debugging
  information produced by the compiler now enables the reconstruction of the
  original backtrace. Use `Printexc.get_raw_backtrace_next_slot` to traverse
  the list of inlined stack frames.
  (Frédéric Bour, review by Mark Shinwell and Xavier Leroy)

- GPR#590: Do not perform compaction if the real overhead is less than expected

  (Florian Angeletti)

- GPR#575: Add the -no-version option to the toplevel

  arrays of values declared using [CAMLlocalN] (Mark Shinwell)

### Compiler distribution build system:

- GPR#324: Compiler developers: Adding new primitives to the
  standard runtime doesn't require anymore to run `make bootstrap`
  (François Bobot)

- GPR#384: Fix compilation using old Microsoft C Compilers not
  supporting secure CRT functions (SDK Visual Studio 2005 compiler and
  earlier) and standard 64-bit integer literals (Visual Studio .NET
  2002 and earlier)
  (David Allsopp)

- GPR#507: More sharing between Unix and Windows makefiles
  (whitequark, review by Alain Frisch)

* GPR#512, GPR#587: Installed `ocamlc`, `ocamlopt`, and `ocamllex` are
  now the native-code versions of the tools, if those versions were
  built.
  (Demi Obenour)

- GPR#525: fix build on OpenIndiana
  (Sergey Avseyev, review by Damien Doligez)

- GPR#687: "./configure -safe-string" to get a system where
  "-unsafe-string" is not allowed, thus giving stronger non-local
  guarantees about immutability of strings
  (Alain Frisch, review by Hezekiah M. Carty)

### Bug fixes:

* PR#6505: Missed Type-error leads to a segfault upon record access.
  (Jacques Garrigue, extra report by Stephen Dolan)
  Proper fix required a more restrictive approach to recursive types:
  mutually recursive types are seen as abstract types (i.e. non-contractive)
  when checking the well-foundedness of the recursion.

* PR#6752: Nominal types and scope escaping.
  Revert to strict scope for non-generalizable type variables, cf. Mantis.
  Note that this is actually stricter than the behavior before 4.03,
  cf. PR#7313, meaning that you may sometimes need to add type annotations
  to explicitly instantiate non-generalizable type variables.

OCaml 4.03.0 (25 Apr 2016):
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

- PR#5528: inline records for constructor arguments
  (Alain Frisch)

- PR#6220, PR#6403, PR#6437, PR#6801:
  Improved redundancy and exhaustiveness checks for GADTs.
  Namely, the redundancy checker now checks whether the uncovered pattern
  of the pattern is actually inhabited, exploding at most one wild card.
  This is also done for exhaustiveness when there is only one case.
  Additionally, one can now write unreachable cases, of the form
  "pat -> .", which are treated by the redundancy check.
  (Jacques Garrigue)

- PR#6374: allow "_ t" as a short-hand for "(_, _, ..) t" for n-ary type
  constructors
  (Alain Frisch)

- PR#6714: allow [@@ocaml.warning] on most structure and signature items:
  values, modules, module types
  (whitequark)

- PR#6806: Syntax shortcut for putting a type annotation on a record field:
  { f1 : typ = e } is sugar for { f1 = (e : typ) }
  { f1 : typ } is sugar for { f1 = (f1 : typ) }
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Jérémie Dimino)

- PR#6806: Allow type annotations before the "->" in "fun <args> -> <expr>"
  fun x y : (int * int) -> (x, y)
  (Valentin Gatien-Baron, review by Jérémie Dimino)

  (Jeremy Yallop)

- GPR#112: octal escape sequences for char and string literals
  "Make it \o033[1mBOLD\o033[0m"
  (Rafaël Bocquet, request by John Whitington)

- GPR#167: allow to annotate externals' arguments and result types so
  they can be unboxed or untagged: [@unboxed], [@untagged]. Supports
  untagging int and unboxing int32, int64, nativeint and float.
  (Jérémie Dimino, Mark Shinwell)

- GPR#173: [@inline] and [@inlined] attributes (for function declarations
  and call sites respectively) to control inlining

  that are represented at runtime by an integer
  (Will Crichton, reviewed by Leo White)

  around "::" when using "::" as user-defined constructor:
  code using "| :: of ..." must change to "| (::) of ...".
  (Runhang Li, review by Damien Doligez)

- GPR#240: replace special annotations on externals by attributes:
  * "float" is generalized to [@@unboxed]
  * "noalloc" becomes [@@noalloc]
  Deprecate "float" and "noalloc".
  (Jérémie Dimino)

- GPR#254: @ocaml.warn_on_literal_pattern attribute on constructors to
  warn when the argument is matches against a constant pattern.  This
  attribute is applied on predefined exception constructors which

  (Thomas Refis, Leo White)

- PR#6681 GPR#326: signature items are now accepted as payloads for
  extension and attributes, using the syntax [%foo: SIG ] or [@foo: SIG ].
  Examples: "[%%client: val foo : int]" or "val%client foo : int".
  (Alain Frisch and Gabriel Radanne)

* GPR#342: Allow shortcuts for extension and attributes on all keywords:
  module%foo, class[@foo], etc.
  The attribute in "let[@foo] .. in .." is now attached to the value binding,
  not to the expression.
  (Gabriel Radanne)

### Compilers:

* PR#4231, PR#5461: warning 31 is now fatal by default
  (Warning 31: A module is linked twice in the same executable.)
  This is an interim solution; double-linking of modules has dangerous
  semantics, eg. exception constructors end up with two distinct declarations.

  instead of warning 25 (all clauses are guarded). 25 isn't raised anymore.
  Projects that set warning 8 as an error may fail to compile (presumably
  this is the semantics they wanted).

  (Jérôme Vouillon)

OCaml 4.02.0 (29 Aug 2014):
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

Language features:
- Attributes and extension nodes
  (Alain Frisch)
- Generative functors (PR#5905)
  (Jacques Garrigue)
* Module aliases
  (Jacques Garrigue)
* Alternative syntax for string literals {id|...|id} (can break comments)
  (Alain Frisch)
- Separation between read-only strings (type string) and read-write byte
  sequences (type bytes). Activated by command-line option -safe-string.
  (Damien Doligez)
- PR#6318: Exception cases in pattern matching
  (Jeremy Yallop, backend by Alain Frisch)
- PR#5584: Extensible open datatypes
  (Leo White)

Build system for the OCaml distribution:
- Use -bin-annot when building.
- Use GNU make instead of portable makefiles.
- Updated build instructions for 32-bit Mac OS X on Intel hardware.

Shedding weight:
* Removed Camlp4 from the distribution, now available as third-party software.
* Removed Labltk from the distribution, now available as a third-party library.

Type system:
* PR#6235: Keep typing of pattern cases independent in principal mode
  (i.e. information from previous cases is no longer used when typing
  patterns; cf. 'PR#6235' in testsuite/test/typing-warnings/records.ml)
  (Jacques Garrigue)
- Allow opening a first-class module or applying a generative functor
  in the body of a generative functor. Allow it also in the body of
  an applicative functor if no types are created
  (Jacques Garrigue, suggestion by Leo White)
* Module aliases are now typed in a specific way, which remembers their
  identity. Compiled interfaces become smaller, but may depend on the
  original modules. This also changes the signature inferred by
  "module type of".
  (Jacques Garrigue, feedback from Leo White, Mark Shinwell and Nick Chapman)
- PR#6331: Slight change in the criterion to distinguish private
  abbreviations and private row types: create a private abbreviation for
  closed objects and fixed polymorphic variants.
  (Jacques Garrigue)
* PR#6333: Compare first class module types structurally rather than
  nominally. Value subtyping allows module subtyping as long as the internal
  representation is unchanged.
  (Jacques Garrigue)

Compilers:
- More aggressive constant propagation, including float and
  int32/int64/nativeint arithmetic.  Constant propagation for floats
  can be turned off with option -no-float-const-prop, for codes that
  change FP rounding modes at run-time.
  (Xavier Leroy)
- New back-end optimization pass: common subexpression elimination (CSE).
  (Reuses results of previous computations instead of recomputing them.)
  (Xavier Leroy)
- New back-end optimization pass: dead code elimination.
  (Removes arithmetic and load instructions whose results are unused.)
  (Xavier Leroy)
- PR#6269: Optimization of sequences of string patterns
  (Benoît Vaugon and Luc Maranget)
- Experimental native code generator for AArch64 (ARM 64 bits)
  (Xavier Leroy)
- PR#6042: Optimization of integer division and modulus by constant divisors
  (Xavier Leroy and Phil Denys)
- Add "-open" command line flag for opening a single module before typing
  (Leo White, Mark Shinwell and Nick Chapman)
* "-o" now sets module name to the output file name up to the first "."
  (it also applies when "-o" is not given, i.e. the module name is then
   the input file name up to the first ".")
  (Leo White, Mark Shinwell and Nick Chapman)
* PR#5779: better sharing of structured constants
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#5817: new flag to keep locations in cmi files
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#5854: issue warning 3 when referring to a value marked with
  the [@@ocaml.deprecated] attribute
  (Alain Frisch, suggestion by Pierre-Marie Pédrot)
- PR#6017: a new format implementation based on GADTs
  (Benoît Vaugon and Gabriel Scherer)
* PR#6203: Constant exception constructors no longer allocate
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#6260: avoid unnecessary boxing in let
  (Vladimir Brankov)
- PR#6345: Better compilation of optional arguments with default values
  (Alain Frisch, review by Jacques Garrigue)
- PR#6389: ocamlopt -opaque option for incremental native compilation
  (Pierre Chambart, Gabriel Scherer)

Toplevel interactive system:
- PR#5377: New "#show_*" directives
  (ygrek, Jacques Garrigue and Alain Frisch)

Runtime system:
- New configure option "-no-naked-pointers" to improve performance by
  avoiding page table tests during block darkening and the marking phase
  of the major GC.  In this mode, all out-of-heap pointers must point at
  things that look like OCaml values: in particular they must have a valid
  header.  The colour of said headers should be black.
  (Mark Shinwell, reviews by Damien Doligez and Xavier Leroy)
- Fixed bug in native code version of [caml_raise_with_string] that could
  potentially lead to heap corruption.
  (Mark Shinwell)
* Blocks initialized by [CAMLlocal*] and [caml_alloc] are now filled with
  [Val_unit] rather than zero.
  (Mark Shinwell)
- Fixed a major performance problem on large heaps (~1GB) by making heap
  increments proportional to heap size by default
  (Damien Doligez)
- PR#4765: Structural equality treats exception specifically
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#5009: efficient comparison/indexing of exceptions
  (Alain Frisch, request by Markus Mottl)
- PR#6075: avoid using unsafe C library functions (strcpy, strcat, sprintf)
  (Xavier Leroy, reports from user 'jfc' and Anil Madhavapeddy)
- An ISO C99-compliant C compiler and standard library is now assumed.
  (Plus special exceptions for MSVC.)  In particular, emulation code for
  64-bit integer arithmetic was removed, the C compiler must support a
  64-bit integer type.
  (Xavier Leroy)

Standard library:
* Add new modules Bytes and BytesLabels for mutable byte sequences.
  (Damien Doligez)
- PR#4986: add List.sort_uniq and Set.of_list
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#5935: a faster version of "raise" which does not maintain the backtrace
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#6146: support "Unix.kill pid Sys.sigkill" under Windows
  (Romain Bardou and Alain Frisch)
- PR#6148: speed improvement for Buffer
  (John Whitington)
- PR#6180: efficient creation of uninitialized float arrays
  (Alain Frisch, request by Markus Mottl)
- PR#6355: Improve documentation regarding finalisers and multithreading
  (Daniel Bünzli, Mark Shinwell)
- Trigger warning 3 for all values marked as deprecated in the documentation.
  (Damien Doligez)

OCamldoc:
- PR#6257: handle full doc comments for variant constructors and
  record fields
  (Maxence Guesdon, request by ygrek)
- PR#6274: allow doc comments on object types
  (Thomas Refis)

OCaml 4.01.0 (12 Sep 2013):
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

Other libraries:
- Labltk: updated to Tcl/Tk 8.6.

Type system:
- PR#5759: use well-disciplined type information propagation to
  disambiguate label and constructor names
  (Jacques Garrigue, Alain Frisch and Leo White)
* Propagate type information towards pattern-matching, even in the presence of
  polymorphic variants (discarding only information about possibly-present
  constructors). As a result, matching against absent constructors is no longer
  allowed for exact and fixed polymorphic variant types.
  (Jacques Garrigue)
* PR#6035: Reject multiple declarations of the same method or instance variable
  in an object
  (Alain Frisch)

Compilers:
- PR#5861: raise an error when multiple private keywords are used in type
  declarations
  (Hongbo Zhang)
- PR#5634: parsetree rewriter (-ppx flag)
  (Alain Frisch)
- ocamldep now supports -absname
  (Alain Frisch)
- PR#5768: On "unbound identifier" errors, use spell-checking to suggest names
  present in the environment
  (Gabriel Scherer)
- ocamlc has a new option -dsource to visualize the parsetree
  (Alain Frisch, Hongbo Zhang)
- tools/eqparsetree compares two parsetree ignoring location
  (Hongbo Zhang)
- ocamlopt now uses clang as assembler on OS X if available, which enables
  CFI support for OS X.
  (Benedikt Meurer)
- Added a new -short-paths option, which attempts to use the shortest
  representation for type constructors inside types, taking open modules
  into account. This can make types much more readable if your code
  uses lots of functors.
  (Jacques Garrigue)
- PR#5986: added flag -compat-32 to ocamlc, ensuring that the generated
  bytecode executable can be loaded on 32-bit hosts.
  (Xavier Leroy)
- PR#5980: warning on open statements which shadow an existing
  identifier (if it is actually used in the scope of the open); new
  open! syntax to silence it locally
  (Alain Frisch, thanks to a report of Daniel Bünzli)
* warning 3 is extended to warn about other deprecated features:
  - ISO-latin1 characters in identifiers
  - uses of the (&) and (or) operators instead of (&&) and (||)
  (Damien Doligez)
- Experimental OCAMLPARAM for ocamlc and ocamlopt
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)
- PR#5571: incorrect ordinal number in error message

- infix application operators |> and @@ in Pervasives
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)
- PR#6176: new Format.asprintf function with a %a formatter
  compatible with Format.fprintf (unlike Format.sprintf)
  (Pierre Weis)

Other libraries:
- PR#5568: add O_CLOEXEC flag to Unix.openfile, so that the returned
  file descriptor is created in close-on-exec mode
  (Xavier Leroy)

Runtime system:
* PR#6019: more efficient implementation of caml_modify() and caml_initialize().
  The new implementations are less lenient than the old ones: now,
  the destination pointer of caml_modify() must point within the minor or
  major heaps, and the destination pointer of caml_initialize() must
  point within the major heap.
  (Xavier Leroy, from an experiment by Brian Nigito, with feedback
  from Yaron Minsky and Gerd Stolpmann)

Internals:
- Moved debugger/envaux.ml to typing/envaux.ml to publish env_of_only_summary
  as part of compilerlibs, to be used on bin-annot files.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)
- The test suite can now be run without installing OCaml first.

OCaml 4.00.0 (26 Jul 2012):
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

- The official name of the language is now OCaml.

Language features:
- Added Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) to the language.
  See chapter "Language extensions" of the reference manual for documentation.
- It is now possible to omit type annotations when packing and unpacking
  first-class modules. The type-checker attempts to infer it from the context.
  Using the -principal option guarantees forward compatibility.
- New (module M) and (module M : S) syntax in patterns, for immediate
  unpacking of a first-class module.

Compilers:
- Revised simplification of let-alias (PR#5205, PR#5288)
- Better reporting of compiler version mismatch in .cmi files
* Warning 28 is now enabled by default.
- New option -absname to use absolute paths in error messages
- Optimize away compile-time beta-redexes, e.g. (fun x y -> e) a b.
- Added option -bin-annot to dump the AST with type annotations.
- Added lots of new warnings about unused variables, opens, fields,
  constructors, etc.
* New meaning for warning 7: it is now triggered when a method is overridden
  with the "method" keyword.  Use "method!" to avoid the warning.

Native-code compiler:
- Optimized handling of partially-applied functions (PR#5287)
- Small improvements in code generated for array bounds checks (PR#5345,
  PR#5360).
* New ARM backend (PR#5433):
    . Supports both Linux/EABI (armel) and Linux/EABI+VFPv3 (armhf).
    . Added support for the Thumb-2 instruction set with average code size
      savings of 28%.
    . Added support for position-independent code, natdynlink, profiling and
      exception backtraces.
- Generation of CFI information, and filename/line number debugging (with -g)
  annotations, enabling in particular precise stack backtraces with
  the gdb debugger. Currently supported for x86 32-bits and 64-bits only.
  (PR#5487)
- New tool: ocamloptp, the equivalent of ocamlcp for the native-code compiler.

OCamldoc:
- PR#5645: ocamldoc doesn't handle module/type substitution in signatures
- PR#5544: improve HTML output (less formatting in html code)
- PR#5522: allow refering to record fields and variant constructors
- fix PR#5419 (error message in french)
- fix PR#5535 (no cross ref to class after dump+load)
* Use first class modules for custom generators, to be able to
  load various plugins incrementally adding features to the current
  generator
* PR#5507: Use Location.t structures for locations.
- fix: do not keep code when not told to keep code.

Standard library:
- Added float functions "hypot" and "copysign" (PR#3806, PR#4752, PR#5246)
* Arg: options with empty doc strings are no longer included in the usage string
  (PR#5437)
- Array: faster implementations of "blit", "copy", "sub", "append" and "concat"
  (PR#2395, PR#2787, PR#4591)
* Hashtbl:
    . Statistically-better generic hash function based on Murmur 3 (PR#5225)
    . Fixed behavior of generic hash function w.r.t. -0.0 and NaN (PR#5222)
    . Added optional "random" parameter to Hashtbl.create to randomize
      collision patterns and improve security (PR#5572, CVE-2012-0839)
    . Added "randomize" function and "R" parameter to OCAMLRUNPARAM
      to turn randomization on by default (PR#5572, CVE-2012-0839)
    . Added new functorial interface "MakeSeeded" to support randomization
      with user-provided seeded hash functions.
    . Install new header <caml/hash.h> for C code.
- Filename: on-demand (lazy) initialization of the PRNG used by "temp_file".
- Marshal: marshalling of function values (flag Marshal.Closures) now
  also works for functions that come from dynamically-loaded modules (PR#5215)
- Random:
     . More random initialization (Random.self_init()), using /dev/urandom
       when available (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, Solaris)
     * Faster implementation of Random.float (changes the generated sequences)
- Format strings for formatted input/output revised to correct PR#5380
    . Consistently treat %@ as a plain @ character
    . Consistently treat %% as a plain % character
- Scanf: width and precision for floating point numbers are now handled
- Scanf: new function "unescaped" (PR#3888)
- Set and Map: more efficient implementation of "filter" and "partition"
- String: new function "map" (PR#3888)

Installation procedure:
- Compiler internals are now installed in `ocamlc -where`/compiler-libs.
  The files available there include the .cmi interfaces for all compiler
  modules, plus the following libraries:
      ocamlcommon.cma/.cmxa     modules common to ocamlc, ocamlopt, ocaml
      ocamlbytecomp.cma/.cmxa   modules for ocamlc and ocaml
      ocamloptcomp.cma/.cmxa    modules specific to ocamlopt
      ocamltoplevel.cma         modules specific to ocaml
   (PR#1804, PR#4653, frequently-asked feature).
* Some .cmi for toplevel internals that used to be installed in
  `ocamlc -where` are now to be found in  `ocamlc -where`/compiler-libs.
  Add "-I +compiler-libs" where needed.
* toplevellib.cma is no longer installed because subsumed by
  ocamlcommon.cma ocamlbytecomp.cma ocamltoplevel.cma
- Added a configuration option (-with-debug-runtime) to compile and install
  a debug version of the runtime system, and a compiler option
  (-runtime-variant) to select the debug runtime.

Objective Caml 3.12.0 (2 Aug 2010):
-----------------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*"  )

Language features:
- Shorthand notation for records: in expressions and patterns,
    { lbl } stands for { lbl = lbl } and { M.lbl } for { M.lbl = lbl }
- Record patterns of the form { lbl = pat; _ } to mark that not all
  labels are listed, purposefully.  (See new warning below.)
- Explicit naming of a generic type; in an expression
  "fun ... (type t) ... -> e", the type t is considered abstract in its
  scope (the arguments that follow it and the body of the function),
  and then replaced by a fresh type variable. In particular, the type
  t can be used in contexts where a type variable is not allowed
  (e.g. for defining an exception in a local module).
- Explicit polymorphic types and polymorphic recursion. In let
  definitions, one can write an explicit polymorphic type just
  immediately the function name; the polymorphism will be enforced,
  and recursive calls may use the polymorphism.
  The syntax is the same as for polymorphic methods:
    "let [rec] <ident> : 'a1 ... 'an. <typexp> = ..."
- First-class packages modules.
  New kind of type expression, for packaged modules: (module PT).
  New kind of expression, to pack a module as a first-class value:
    (module MODEXPR : PT).
  New kind of module expression, to unpack a first-class value as a module:
    (val EXPR : PT).
  PT is a package type of the form "S" or
  "S with type t1 = ... and ... and type tn = ..." (S refers to a module type).
- Local opening of modules in a subexpression.
  Syntax: "let open M in e", or "M.(e)"
- In class definitions, method and instance variable override can now
  be made explicit, by writing "method!", "val!" or "inherit!" in place of
  "method", "val" and "inherit". It is an error to override an
  undefined member (or to use overriding inheritance when nothing get
  overridden). Additionally, these constructs disactivate respectively
  warnings 7 (method override, code 'M') and 13 (instance variable
  override, code 'V'). Note that, by default, warning 7 is inactive
  and warning 13 is active.
- "Destructive" substitution in signatures.
  By writing "<signature> with type t := <typeconstr>" and
  "<signature> with module M := <module-path>" one replaces "t" and "M"
  inside the signature, removing their respective fields. Among other
  uses, this allows to merge two signatures containing identically
  named fields.
* While fixing PR#4824, also corrected a gaping hole in the type checker,
  which allowed instantiating separately object parameters and instance
  variables in an interface. This hole was here since the beginning of
  ocaml, and as a result many programs using object inheritance in a non
  trivial way will need to be corrected. You can look at lablgtk2 for an
  example.

Compilers and toplevel:
- Warnings are now numbered and can be switched on and off individually.
  The old system with letters referring to sets of warnings is still
  supported.
- New warnings:
  + 9 (code 'R') to signal record patterns without "; _" where
    some labels of the record type are not listed in the pattern.
  + 28 when giving a wildcard argument to a constant constructor in
    a pattern-matching.
  + 29 when an end-of-line appears unescaped in a string constant.
  + 30 when the same constructor or record field is defined twice in
    mutually-recursive type definitions.
* The semantics of warning 7 (code 'M', method override) have changed
  (it now detects all overrides, not just repeated definitions inside
  the same class body), and it is now inactive by default.
- Better error report in case of unbound qualified identifier: if the module
  is unbound this error is reported in the first place.
- Added option '-strict-sequence' to force left hand part of sequence to have
  type unit.
- Added option '-no-app-funct' to turn applicative functors off.
  This option can help working around mysterious type incompatibilities
  caused by the incomplete comparison of applicative paths F(X).t.

Native-code compiler:
- AMD64: shorter and slightly more efficient code generated for
  float comparisons.

Standard library:
- Format: new function ikfprintf analoguous to ifprintf with a continuation
  argument.
* PR#4210, #4245: stricter range checking in string->integer conversion
  functions (int_of_string, Int32.of_string, Int64.of_string,
  Nativeint.of_string).  The decimal string corresponding to
  max_int + 1 is no longer accepted.
- Scanf: to prevent confusion when mixing Scanf scanning functions and direct
  low level input, value Scanf.stdin has been added.
* Random: changed the algorithm to produce better randomness.  Now passes the
  DieHard tests.
- Map: implement functions from Set that make sense for Map.

Other libraries:
* Str: letters that constitute a word now include digits 0-9 and
  underscore _.  This changes the interpretation of '\b' (word boundary)
  in regexps, but is more consistent with other regexp libraries. (PR#4874).

Ocamlbuild:
- Add support for native dynlink.

New tool:
- ocamlobjinfo: displays various information, esp. dependencies, for
  compiled OCaml files (.cmi, .cmo, .cma, .cmx, .cmxa, .cmxs, and bytecode
  executables).  Extends and makes more official the old objinfo tool
  that was installed by some OCaml packages.

All tools:
- PR#4857: add a -vnum option to display the version number and nothing else

Objective Caml 3.11.0 (03 Dec 2008):
------------------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*"  )

Language features:
- Addition of lazy patterns: "lazy <pat>" matches suspensions whose values,
  after forcing, match the pattern <pat>.
- Introduction of private abbreviation types "type t = private <type-expr>",
  for abstracting the actual manifest type in type abbreviations.
- Subtyping is now allowed between a private abbreviation and its definition,
  and between a polymorphic method and its monomorphic instance.

Compilers:
- The file name for a compilation unit should correspond to a valid
  identifier (Otherwise dynamic linking and other things can fail, and
  a warning is emitted.)
* Revised -output-obj: the output name must now be provided; its
  extension must be one of .o/.obj, .so/.dll, or .c for the
  bytecode compiler. The compilers can now produce a shared library
  (with all the needed -ccopts/-ccobjs options) directly.
- -dtypes renamed to -annot, records (in .annot files) which function calls
  are tail calls.
- All compiler error messages now include a file name and location, for
  better interaction with Emacs' compilation mode.
- Optimized compilation of "lazy e" when the argument "e" is
  already evaluated.
- Optimized compilation of equality tests with a variant constant constructor.
- The -dllib options recorded in libraries are no longer ignored when
  -use_runtime or -use_prims is used (unless -no_auto_link is
  explicitly used).
- Check that at most one of -pack, -a, -shared, -c, -output-obj is
  given on the command line.
- Optimized compilation of private types as regular manifest types
  (e.g. abbreviation to float, float array or record types with only
   float fields).

Native-code compiler:
- New port: Mac OS X / Intel in 64-bit mode (configure with -cc "gcc -m64").
- A new option "-shared" to produce a plugin that can be dynamically
  loaded with the native version of Dynlink.
- A new option "-nodynlink" to enable optimizations valid only for code
  that is never dynlinked (no-op except for AMD64).
- More aggressive unboxing of floats and boxed integers.
- Can select which assembler and asm options to use at configuration time.

Run-time system:
- New implementation of the page table describing the heap (two-level
  array in 32 bits, sparse hashtable in 64 bits), fixes issues with address
  space randomization on 64-bit OS (PR#4448).
- New "generational" API for registering global memory roots with the GC,
  enables faster scanning of global roots.
  (The functions are caml_*_generational_global_root in <caml/memory.h>.)
- New function "caml_raise_with_args" to raise an exception with several
  arguments from C.
- Changes in implementation of dynamic linking of C code:
  under Win32, use Alain Frisch's flexdll implementation of the dlopen
  API; under MacOSX, use dlopen API instead of MacOSX bundle API.
- Programs may now choose a first-fit allocation policy instead of
  the default next-fit.  First-fit reduces fragmentation but is
  slightly slower in some cases.

Standard library:
- Parsing library: new function "set_trace" to programmatically turn
  on or off the printing of a trace during parsing.
- Printexc library: new functions "print_backtrace" and "get_backtrace"
  to obtain a stack backtrace of the most recently raised exception.
  New function "record_backtrace" to turn the exception backtrace mechanism
  on or off from within a program.
- Scanf library: fine-tuning of meta format implementation;
  fscanf behaviour revisited: only one input buffer is allocated for any
  given input channel;
  the %n conversion does not count a lookahead character as read.

Other libraries:
- Dynlink: on some platforms, the Dynlink library is now available in
  native code. The boolean Dynlink.is_native allows the program to
  know whether it has been compiled in bytecode or in native code.
- Bigarrays: added "unsafe_get" and "unsafe_set"
  (non-bound-checking versions of "get" and "set").
- Bigarrays: removed limitation "array dimension < 2^31".
- Labltk: added support for TK 8.5.
- Num: added conversions between big_int and int32, nativeint, int64.
  More efficient implementation of Num.quo_num and Num.mod_num.
- Threads: improved efficiency of mutex and condition variable operations;
  improved interaction with Unix.fork (PR#4577).
- Unix: added getsockopt_error returning type Unix.error.
  Added support for TCP_NODELAY and IPV6_ONLY socket options.
- Win32 Unix: "select" now supports all kinds of file descriptors.
  Improved emulation of "lockf" (PR#4609).

Tools:
- ocamldebug now supported under Windows (MSVC and Mingw ports),
  but without the replay feature.  (Contributed by Dmitry Bely
  and Sylvain Le Gall at OCamlCore with support from Lexifi.)
- ocamldoc: new option -no-module-constraint-filter to include functions
  hidden by signature constraint in documentation.
- ocamlmklib and ocamldep.opt now available under Windows ports.
- ocamlmklib no longer supports the -implib option.
- ocamlnat: an experimental native toplevel (not built by default).

Camlp4:
* programs linked with camlp4lib.cma now also need dynlink.cma.

  out-of-heap pointers.
- PR#3915: updated most man pages.

- PR#4585: ocamldoc and "val virtual" declarations.
- PR#4587: ocamldoc and escaped @ characters.
- PR#4605: Buffer.add_substitute was sometime wrong when target string had
           backslashes.
- PR#4614: Inconsistent declaration of CamlCBCmd in LablTk library.

  emacs files


Objective Caml 3.10.0 (18 May 2007):
------------------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*"  )

Language features:
- Added virtual instance variables in classes "val virtual v : t"
* Changed the behaviour of instance variable overriding; the new
  definition replaces the old one, rather than creating a new
  variable.

New tools:
- ocamlbuild: compilation manager for OCaml applications and libraries.
  See draft documentation at http://gallium.inria.fr/~pouillar/
* Camlp4: heavily revised implementation, new API.

New ports:
- MacOS X PowerPC 64 bits.
- MS Windows 64 bits (x64) using the Microsoft PSDK toolchain.
- MS Windows 32 bits using the Visual Studio 2005 toolchain.

Compilers:
- Faster type-checking of functor applications.
- Referencing an interface compiled with -rectypes from a module
    not compiled with -rectypes is now an error.
- Revised the "fragile matching" warning.

Native-code compiler:
- Print a stack backtrace on an uncaught exception.
  (Compile and link with ocamlopt -g; execute with OCAMLRUNPARAM=b.)
  Supported on Intel/AMD in 32 and 64 bits, PPC in 32 and 64 bits.
- Stack overflow detection on MS Windows 32 bits (courtesy O. Andrieu).
- Stack overflow detection on MacOS X PPC and Intel.
- Intel/AMD 64 bits: generate position-independent code by default.
- Fixed bug involving -for-pack and missing .cmx files (PR#4124).
- Fixed bug causing duplication of literals  (PR#4152).

Run-time system:
- C/Caml interface functions take "char const *" arguments
  instead of "char *" when appropriate.
- Faster string comparisons (fast case if strings are ==).

Standard library:
- Refined typing of format strings (type format6).
- Printf, Format: new function ifprintf that consumes its arguments
    and prints nothing (useful to print conditionally).
- Scanf:
    new function format_from_string to convert a string to a format string;
    new %r conversion to accomodate user defined scanners.
- Filename: improved Win32 implementation of Filename.quote.
- List: List.nth now tail-recursive.
- Sys: added Sys.is_directory.  Some functions (e.g. Sys.command) that
    could incorrectly raise Sys_io_blocked now raise Sys_error as intended.
- String and Char: the function ``escaped'' now escapes all the characters
    especially handled by the compiler's lexer (PR#4220).

Other libraries:
- Bigarray: mmap_file takes an optional argument specifying
    the start position of the data in the mapped file.
- Dynlink: now defines only two modules, Dynlink and Dynlinkaux (internal),
    reducing risks of name conflicts with user modules.
- Labltk under Win32: now uses Tcl/Tk 8.4 instead of 8.3 by default.
- VM threads: improved performance of I/O operations (less polling).
- Unix: new function Unix.isatty.
- Unix emulation under Win32:
    fixed incorrect error reporting in several functions (PR#4097);
    better handling of channels opened on sockets (PR#4098);
    fixed GC bug in Unix.system (PR#4112).

Documentation generator (OCamldoc):
- correctly handle '?' in value names (PR#4215)
- new option -hide-warnings not to print ocamldoc warnings

Lexer generator (ocamllex): improved error reporting.

License: fixed a typo in the "special exception" to the LGPL.

Objective Caml 3.09.0 (27 Oct 2006):
------------------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*"  )

Language features:
- Introduction of private row types, for abstracting the row in object
  and variant types.

Type checking:
- Polymorphic variants with at most one constructor [< `A of t] are no
  longer systematically promoted to the exact type [`A of t]. This was
  more confusing than useful, and created problems with private row
  types.

Both compilers:
- Added warnings 'Y' and 'Z' for local variables that are bound but
  never used.
- Added warning for some uses non-returning functions (e.g. raise), when they
  are passed extra arguments, or followed by extra statements.
- Pattern matching: more prudent compilation in case of guards; fixed PR#3780.
- Compilation of classes: reduction in size of generated code.
- Compilation of "module rec" definitions: fixed a bad interaction with
  structure coercion (to a more restrictive signature).

Native-code compiler (ocamlopt):
* Revised implementation of the -pack option (packing of several compilation
  units into one).  The .cmx files that are to be packed with
  "ocamlopt -pack -o P.cmx" must be compiled with "ocamlopt -for-pack P".
  In exchange for this additional constraint, ocamlopt -pack is now
  available on all platforms (no need for binutils).
* Fixed wrong evaluation order for arguments to certain inlined functions.
- Modified code generation for "let rec ... and ..." to reduce compilation
  time (which was quadratic in the number of mutually-recursive functions).
- x86 port: support tail-calls for functions with up to 21 arguments.
- AMD64 port, Linux: recover from system stack overflow.
- Sparc port: more portable handling of out-of-bound conditions
  on systems other than Solaris.

Standard library:
- Pervasives: faster implementation of close_in, close_out.
  set_binary_mode_{out,in} now working correctly under Cygwin.
- Printf: better handling of partial applications of the printf functions.
- Scanf: new function sscanf_format to read a format from a
  string. The type of the resulting format is dynamically checked and
  should be the type of the template format which is the second argument.
- Scanf: no more spurious lookahead attempt when the end of file condition
  is set and a correct token has already been read and could be returned.

Other libraries:
- System threads library: added Thread.sigmask; fixed race condition
  in signal handling.
- Bigarray library: fixed bug in Array3.of_array.
- Unix library: use canonical signal numbers in results of Unix.wait*;
  hardened Unix.establish_server against EINTR errors.

Run-time system:
- Support platforms where sizeof(void *) = 8 and sizeof(long) = 4.
- Improved and cleaned up implementation of signal handling.

Replay debugger:
- Improved handling of locations in source code.

OCamldoc:
- extensible {foo } syntax
- user can give .txt files on the command line, containing ocamldoc formatted
  text, to be able to include bigger texts out of source files
- -o option is now used by the html generator to indicate the prefix
  of generated index files (to avoid conflict when a Index module exists
  on case-insensitive file systems).

Miscellaneous:
- Configuration information is installed in `ocamlc -where`/Makefile.config
  and can be used by client Makefiles or shell scripts.

Objective Caml 3.08.4 (11 Aug 2005):
------------------------------------

New features:
- configure: find X11 config in some 64-bit Linux distribs

Objective Caml 3.08.3 (24 Mar 2005):
------------------------------------

New features:
- support for ocamlopt -pack under Mac OS X (PR#2634, PR#3320)
- ignore unknown warning options for forward and backward compatibility
- runtime: export caml_compare_unordered (PR#3479)
- camlp4: install argl.* files (PR#3439)
- ocamldoc: add -man-section option
- labltk: add the "solid" relief option (PR#3343)

Bug fixes:
- typing: fix unsoundness in type declaration variance inference.
    Type parameters which are constrained must now have an explicit variant
    annotation, otherwise they are invariant. This is not backward
    compatible, so this might break code which either uses subtyping or
    uses the relaxed value restriction (i.e. was not typable before 3.07)
- typing: erroneous partial match warning for polymorphic variants (PR#3424)
- runtime: handle the case of an empty command line (PR#3409, PR#3444)
- stdlib: make Sys.executable_name an absolute path in native code (PR#3303)
- runtime: fix memory leak in finalise.c

Objective Caml 3.08.0 (13 Jul 2004):
------------------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*"  )

Language features:
- Support for immediate objects, i.e. objects defined without going
  through a class.  (Syntax is "object <fields and methods> end".)

Type-checking:
- When typing record construction and record patterns, can omit
  the module qualification on all labels except one.  I.e.
  { M.l1 = ...; l2 = ... } is interpreted as { M.l1 = ...; M.l2 = ... }

Both compilers:
- More compact compilation of classes.
- Much more efficient handling of class definitions inside functors
  or local modules.
- Simpler representation for method tables. Objects can now be marshaled
  between identical programs with the flag Marshal.Closures.
- Improved error messages for objects and variants.
- Improved printing of inferred module signatures (toplevel and ocamlc -i).
  Recursion between type, class, class type and module definitions is now
  correctly printed.
- The -pack option now accepts compiled interfaces (.cmi files) in addition
  to compiled implementations (.cmo or .cmx).
* A compile-time error is signaled if an integer literal exceeds the
  range of representable integers.
- Fixed code generation error for "module rec" definitions.
- The combination of options -c -o sets the name of the generated
  .cmi / .cmo / .cmx files.

Bytecode compiler:
- Option -output-obj is now compatible with Dynlink and
  with embedded toplevels.

Native-code compiler:
- Division and modulus by zero correctly raise exception Division_by_zero
  (instead of causing a hardware trap).
- Improved compilation time for the register allocation phase.
- The float constant -0.0 was incorrectly treated as +0.0 on some processors.
- AMD64: fixed bugs in asm glue code for GC invocation and exception raising
  from C.
- IA64: fixed incorrect code generated for "expr mod 1".
- PowerPC: minor performance tweaks for the G4 and G5 processors.

Standard library:
* Revised handling of NaN floats in polymorphic comparisons.
  The polymorphic boolean-valued comparisons (=, <, >, etc) now treat
  NaN as uncomparable, as specified by the IEEE standard.
  The 3-valued comparison (compare) treats NaN as equal to itself
  and smaller than all other floats.  As a consequence, x == y
  no longer implies x = y but still implies compare x y = 0.
* String-to-integer conversions now fail if the result overflows
  the range of integers representable in the result type.
* All array and string access functions now raise
  Invalid_argument("index out of bounds") when a bounds check fails.
  In earlier releases, different exceptions were raised
  in bytecode and native-code.
- Module Buffer: new functions Buffer.sub, Buffer.nth
- Module Int32: new functions Int32.bits_of_float, Int32.float_of_bits.
- Module Map: new functions is_empty, compare, equal.
- Module Set: new function split.
* Module Gc: in-order finalisation, new function finalise_release.

Other libraries:
- The Num library: complete reimplementation of the C/asm lowest
  layer to work around potential licensing problems.
  Improved speed on the PowerPC and AMD64 architectures.
- The Graphics library: improved event handling under MS Windows.
- The Str library: fixed bug in "split" functions with nullable regexps.
- The Unix library:
   . Added Unix.single_write.
   . Added support for IPv6.
   . Bug fixes in Unix.closedir.
   . Allow thread switching on Unix.lockf.

Runtime System:
* Name space depollution: all global C identifiers are now prefixed
  with "caml" to avoid name clashes with other libraries.  This
  includes the "external" primitives of the standard runtime.

Ports:
- Windows ports: many improvements in the OCamlWin toplevel application
  (history, save inputs to file, etc).  Contributed by Christopher A. Watford.
- Native-code compilation supported for HPPA/Linux. Contributed by Guy Martin.
- Removed support for MacOS9.  Mac OS 9 is obsolete and the port was not
  updated since 3.05.
- Removed ocamlopt support for HPPA/Nextstep and Power/AIX.

Ocamllex:
- #line directives in the input file are now accepted.
- Added character set concatenation operator "cset1 # cset2".

Ocamlyacc:
- #line directives in the input file are now accepted.

Camlp4:
* Support for new-style locations (line numbers, not just character numbers).
- See camlp4/CHANGES and camlp4/ICHANGES for more info.


Objective Caml 3.07 (29 Sep 2003):
----------------------------------

Language features:
- Experimental support for recursive module definitions
      module rec A : SIGA = StructA and B : SIGB = StructB and ...
- Support for "private types", or more exactly concrete data types
  with private constructors or labels.  These data types can be
  de-structured normally in pattern matchings, but values of these
  types cannot be constructed directly outside of their defining module.
- Added integer literals of types int32, nativeint, int64
  (written with an 'l', 'n' or 'L' suffix respectively).

Type-checking:
- Allow polymorphic generalization of covariant parts of expansive
  expressions.  For instance, if f: unit -> 'a list, "let x = f ()"
  gives "x" the generalized type forall 'a. 'a list, instead of '_a list
  as before.
- The typing of polymorphic variants in pattern matching has changed.
  It is intended to be more regular, sticking to the principle of "closing
  only the variants which would be otherwise incomplete". Two potential
  consequences: (1) some types may be left open which were closed before,
  and the resulting type might not match the interface anymore (expected to
  be rare); (2) in some cases an incomplete match may be generated.
- Lots of bug fixes in the handling of polymorphism and recursion inside
  types.
- Added a new "-dtypes" option to ocamlc/ocamlopt, and an emacs extension
  "emacs/caml-types.el".  The compiler option saves inferred type information
  to file *.annot, and the emacs extension allows the user to look at the
  type of any subexpression in the source file.  Works even in the case
  of a type error (all the types computed up to the error are available).
  This new feature is also supported by ocamlbrowser.
- Disable "method is overridden" warning when the method was explicitly
  redefined as virtual beforehand (i.e. not through inheritance). Typing
  and semantics are unchanged.

Both compilers:
- Added option "-dtypes" to dump detailed type information to a file.
- The "-i" option no longer generates compiled files, it only prints
  the inferred types.
- The sources for the module named "Mod" can be placed either in Mod.ml or
  in mod.ml.
- Compilation of "let rec" on non-functional values: tightened some checks,
  relaxed some other checks.
- Fixed wrong code that was generated for "for i = a to max_int"
  or "for i = a downto min_int".
- An explicit interface Mod.mli can now be provided for the module obtained
  by ocamlc -pack -o Mod.cmo ... or ocamlopt -pack -o Mod.cmx ...
- Revised internal handling of source code locations, now handles
  preprocessed code better.
- Pattern-matching bug on float literals fixed.
- Minor improvements on pattern-matching over variants.
- More efficient compilation of string comparisons and the "compare" function.
- More compact code generated for arrays of constants.
- Fixed GC bug with mutable record fields of type "exn".
- Added warning "E" for "fragile patterns": pattern matchings that would
  not be flagged as partial if new constructors were added to the data type.

Bytecode compiler:
- Added option -vmthread to select the threads library with VM-level
  scheduling.  The -thread option now selects the system threads library.

Native-code compiler:
- New port: AMD64 (Opteron).
- Fixed instruction selection bug on expressions of the kind (raise Exn)(arg).
- Several bug fixes in ocamlopt -pack (tracking of imported modules,
  command line too long).
- Signal handling bug fixed.
- x86 port:
    Added -ffast-math option to use inline trigo and log functions.
    Small performance tweaks for the Pentium 4.
    Fixed illegal "imul" instruction generated by reloading phase.
- Sparc port:
    Enhanced code generation for Sparc V8 (option -march=v8) and
    Sparc V9 (option -march=v9).
    Profiling support added for Solaris.
- PowerPC port:
    Keep stack 16-aligned for compatibility with C calling conventions.

Toplevel interactive system:
- Tightened interface consistency checks between .cmi files, .cm[oa] files
  loaded by #load, and the running toplevel.
- #trace on mutually-recursive functions was broken, works again.
- Look for .ocamlinit file in home directory in addition to the current dir.

Standard library:
- Match_failure and Assert_failure exceptions now report
  (file, line, column), instead of (file, starting char, ending char).
- float_of_string, int_of_string: some ill-formed input strings were not
    rejected.
- Added format concatenation, string_of_format, format_of_string.
- Module Arg: added new option handlers Set_string, Set_int, Set_float,
    Symbol, Tuple.
- Module Format: tag handling is now turned off by default,
    use [Format.set_tags true] to activate.
- Modules Lexing and Parsing: added better handling of positions
    in source file.  Added function Lexing.flush_input.
- Module Scanf: %n and %N formats to count characters / items read so far;
    assorted bug fixes, %! to match end of input. New ``_'' special
    flag to skip reresulting value.
- Module Format: tags are not activated by default.
- Modules Set and Map: fixed bugs causing trees to become unbalanced.
- Module Printf: less restrictive typing of kprintf.
- Module Random: better seeding; functions to generate random int32, int64,
    nativeint; added support for explicit state management.
- Module Sys: added Sys.readdir for reading the contents of a directory.

Runtime system:
- output_value/input_value: fixed bug with large blocks (>= 4 Mwords)
  produced on a 64-bit platform and incorrectly read back on a 32-bit
  platform.
- Fixed memory compaction bug involving input_value.
- Added MacOS X support for dynamic linking of C libraries.
- Improved stack backtraces on uncaught exceptions.
- Fixed float alignment problem on Sparc V9 with gcc 3.2.

Other libraries:
- Dynlink:
    By default, dynamically-loaded code now has access to all
      modules defined by the program; new functions Dynlink.allow_only
      and Dynlink.prohibit implement access control.
    Fixed Dynlink problem with files generated with ocamlc -pack.
    Protect against references to modules not yet fully initialized.
- LablTK/CamlTK: added support for TCL/TK 8.4.
- Str: reimplemented regexp matching engine, now less buggy, faster,
    and LGPL instead of GPL.
- Graphics: fixed draw_rect and fill_rect bug under X11.
- System threads and bytecode threads libraries can be both installed.
- System threads: better implementation of Thread.exit.
- Bytecode threads: fixed two library initialization bugs.
- Unix: make Unix.openfile blocking to account for named pipes;
  GC bug in Unix.*stat fixed; fixed problem with Unix.dup2 on Windows.

Ocamllex:
- Can name parts of the matched input text, e.g.
    "0" (['0'-'7']+ as s) { ... s ... }

Ocamldebug:
- Handle programs that run for more than 2^30 steps.

Emacs mode:
- Added file caml-types.el to interactively display the type information
  saved by option -dtypes.

Win32 ports:
- Cygwin port: recognize \ as directory separator in addition to /
- MSVC port: ocamlopt -pack works provided GNU binutils are installed.

Objective Caml 3.04 (13 Dec 2001):
----------------------------------

Type-checker:
- Allowed coercing self to the type of the current class, avoiding
  an obscure error message about "Self type cannot be unified..."

Both compilers:
- Use OCAMLLIB environment variable to find standard library, falls
  back on CAMLLIB if not defined.
- Report out-of-range ASCII escapes in character or string literals
  such as "\256".

Byte-code compiler:
- The -use-runtime and -make-runtime flags are back by popular demand
  (same behavior as in 3.02).
- Dynamic loading (of the C part of mixed Caml/C libraries): arrange that
  linking in -custom mode uses the static libraries for the C parts,
  not the shared libraries, for maximal robustness and compatibility with
  3.02.

Native-code compiler:
- Fixed bug in link-time consistency checking.

Tools:
- ocamlyacc: added parser debugging support (set OCAMLRUNPARAM=p to get
  a trace of the pushdown automaton actions).
- ocamlcp: was broken in 3.03 (Sys_error), fixed.

Run-time system:
- More work on dynamic loading of the C part of mixed Caml/C libraries.
- On uncaught exception, flush output channels before printing exception
  message and backtrace.
- Corrected several errors in exception backtraces.

Standard library:
- Pervasives: integer division and modulus are now fully specified

  on Hashtbl.add.
- New module MoreLabels providing labelized versions of modules
  Hashtbl, Map and Set.

Emacs mode: small fixes; special color highlighting for ocamldoc comments.

License: added special exception to the LGPL'ed code (libraries and
  runtime system) allowing unrestricted linking, whether static or dynamic.


Objective Caml 3.03 ALPHA (12 Oct 2001):
----------------------------------------

Language:
- Removed built-in syntactic sugar for streams and stream patterns
  [< ... >], now supported via CamlP4, which is now included in the
  distribution.
- Switched the default behaviour to labels mode (labels are compulsory),
  but allows omitting labels when a function application is complete.
  -nolabels mode is available but deprecated for programming.
  (See also scrapelabels and addlabels tools below.)
- Removed all labels in the standard libraries, except labltk.
  Labelized versions are kept for ArrayLabels, ListLabels, StringLabels
  and UnixLabels. "open StdLabels" gives access to the first three.
- Extended polymorphic variant type syntax, allowing union types and
  row abbreviations for both sub- and super-types. #t deprecated in types.
- See the Upgrading file for how to adapt to all the changes above.

Type-checker:
- Fixed obscure bug in module typing causing the type-checker to loop
  on signatures of the form
        module type M
        module A: sig module type T = sig module T: M end end
        module B: A.T
- Improved efficiency of module type-checking via lazy computation of
  certain signature summary information.
- An empty polymorphic variant type is now an error.

Both compilers:
- Fixed wrong code generated for "struct include M ... end" when M
  contains one or several "external" declarations.

Byte-code compiler:
- Protect against VM stack overflow caused by module initialization code
  with many local variables.
- Support for dynamic loading of the C part of mixed Caml/C libraries.

  works on x86 under Linux and BSD.
- Alpha: work around "as" bug in Tru64 5.1.

- Revised printing of inferred types and evaluation results
  so that an external printer (e.g. Camlp4's) can be hooked in.

Tools:
- The CamlP4 pre-processor-pretty-printer is now included in the standard
  distribution.
- New tool ocamlmklib to help build mixed Caml/C libraries.
- New tool scrapelabels and addlabels, to either remove (non-optional)
  labels in interfaces, or automatically add them in the definitions.
  They provide easy transition from classic mode ocaml 3.02 sources,
  depending on whether you want to keep labels or not.
- ocamldep: added -pp option to handle preprocessed source files.

Run-time system:
- Support for dynamic loading of the C part of mixed Caml/C libraries.
  Currently works under Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, Tru64, Solaris and Irix.
- Implemented registration of global C roots with a skip list,
  runs much faster when there are many global C roots.
- Autoconfiguration script: fixed wrong detection of Mac OS X; problem
  with the Sparc, gcc 3.0, and float alignment fixed.

Standard library:
- Added Pervasives.flush_all to flush all opened output channels.

Other libraries:
- All libraries revised to allow dynamic loading of the C part.
- Graphics under X Windows: revised event handling, should no longer lose
    mouse events between two calls to wait_next_event(); wait_next_event()
    now interruptible by signals.
- Bigarrays: fixed bug in marshaling of big arrays.

Windows port:
- Fixed broken Unix.{get,set}sockopt*



Objective Caml 3.02 (30 Jul 2001):

Byte-code compiler:
- Protect against VM stack overflow caused by functions with many local
  variables.

Native-code compiler:
- Removed re-sharing of string literals, causes too many surprises with
  in-place string modifications.
- Corrected wrong compilation of toplevel "include" statements.
- Fixed bug in runtime function "callbackN_exn".
- Signal handlers receive the conventional signal number as argument
  instead of the system signal number (same behavior as with the
  bytecode compiler).
- ARM port: fixed issue with immediate operand overflow in large functions.

Toplevel environment:
- User-definer printers (for #install_printer) now receive as first argument
  the pretty-printer formatter where to print their second argument.
  Old printers (with only one argument) still supported for backward
  compatibility.

Standard library:
- Module Hashtbl: added Hashtbl.fold.

Other libraries:
- Dynlink: better error reporting in add_interfaces for missing .cmi files.
- Graphics: added more drawing functions (multiple points, polygons,
    multiple lines, splines).
- Bytecode threads: the module Unix is now thread-safe, ThreadUnix is
    deprecated.  Unix.exec* now resets standard descriptors to blocking mode.
- Native threads: fixed a context-switch-during-GC problem causing
    certain C runtime functions to fail, most notably input_value.
- Unix.inet_addr_of_string: call inet_aton() when available so as to
    handle correctly the address 255.255.255.255.
- Unix: added more getsockopt and setsockopt functions to get/set
    options that have values other than booleans.
- Num: added documentation for the Big_int module.

Tools:
- ocamldep: fixed wrong dependency issue with nested modules.

Run-time system:
- Removed floating-point error at start-up on some non-IEEE platforms
  (e.g. FreeBSD prior to 4.0R).
- Stack backtrace mechanism now works for threads that terminate on
  an uncaught exception.

Auto-configuration:
- Updated config.guess and config.sub scripts, should recognize a greater
  number of recent platform.

Windows port:
- Fixed broken Unix.waitpid.  Unix.file_descr can now be compared or hashed.
- Toplevel application: issue with spaces in name of stdlib directory fixed.

MacOS 9 port:
- Removed the last traces of support for 68k


Objective Caml 3.01 (09 Mar 2001):
----------------------------------

New language features:
- Variables are allowed in "or" patterns, e.g.
     match l with [t] | [_;t] -> ... t ...
- "include <structure expression>" to re-export all components of a
  structure inside another structure.
- Variance annotation on parameters of type declarations, e.g.
    type (+'a,-'b,'c) t (covariant in 'a, contravariant in 'b, invariant in 'c)

New ports:
- Intel IA64/Itanium under Linux (including the native-code compiler).
- Cygwin under MS Windows.  This port is an alternative to the earlier
  Windows port of OCaml, which relied on MS compilers; the Cygwin
  Windows port does not need MS Visual C++ nor MASM, runs faster
  in bytecode, and has a better implementation of the Unix library,
  but currently lacks threads and COM component support.

Type-checking:
- Relaxed "monomorphic restriction" on type constructors in a
  mutually-recursive type definition, e.g. the following is again allowed
    type u = C of int t | D of string t and 'a t = ...
- Fixed name-capture bug in "include SIG" and "SIG with ..." constructs.
- Improved implicit subtypes built by (... :> ty), closer to intuition.
- Several bug fixes in type-checking of variants.
- Typing of polymorphic variants is more restrictive:
   do not allow conjunctive types inside the same pattern matching.
   a type has either an upper bound, or all its tags are in the lower bound.
  This may break some programs (this breaks lablgl-0.94).

Both compilers:
- Revised compilation of pattern matching.
- Option -I +<subdir> to search a subdirectory <subdir> of the standard
  library directory (i.e. write "ocamlc -I +labltk" instead of
  "ocamlc -I /usr/local/lib/ocaml/labltk").
- Option -warn-error to turn warnings into errors.
- Option -where to print the location of the standard library directory.
- Assertions are now type-checked even if the -noassert option is given,
  thus -noassert can no longe change the types of modules.

Bytecode compiler and bytecode interpreter:
- Print stack backtrace when a program aborts due to an uncaught exception
  (requires compilation with -g and running with ocamlrun -b or
   OCAMLRUNPARAM="b=1").

Native-code compiler:
- Better unboxing optimizations on the int32, int64, and nativeint types.
- Tail recursion preserved for functions having more parameters than
  available registers (but tail calls to other functions are still
  turned off if parameters do not fit entirely in registers).
- Fixed name-capture bug in function inlining.
- Improved spilling/reloading strategy for conditionals.
- IA32, Alpha: better alignment of branch targets.
- Removed spurious dependency on the -lcurses library.

Toplevel environment:
- Revised handling of top-level value definitions, allows reclaimation
  of definitions that are shadowed by later definitions with the same names.
  (E.g. "let x = <big list>;; let x = 1;;" allows <big list> to be reclaimed.)
- Revised the tracing facility so that for standard library functions,
  only calls from user code are traced, not calls from the system.
- Added a "*" prompt when within a comment.

Runtime system:
- Fixed portability issue on bcopy() vs memmove(), affecting Linux RedHat 7.0
  in particular.
- Structural comparisons (=, <>, <, <=, >, >=, compare) reimplemented
  so as to avoid overflowing the C stack.
- Input/output functions: arrange so that reads and writes on closed
  in_channel or out_channel raise Sys_error immediately.

Standard library:
- Module Gc: changed some counters to float in order to avoid overflow;
    added alarms
- Module Hashtbl: added Hashtbl.replace.
- Module Int64: added bits_of_float, float_of_bits (access to IEEE 754
    representation of floats).
- Module List:  List.partition now tail-rec;
    improved memory behavior of List.stable_sort.
- Module Nativeint: added Nativeint.size (number of bits in a nativeint).
- Module Obj: fixed incorrect resizing of float arrays in Obj.resize.
- Module Pervasives: added float constants "infinity", "neg_infinity", "nan";
    added a "classify_float" function to test a float for NaN, infinity, etc.
- Pervasives.input_value: fixed bug affecting shared custom objects.
- Pervasives.output_value: fixed size bug affecting "int64" values.
- Pervasives.int_of_string, {Int32,Int64,Nativeint}.of_string:
  fixed bug causing bad digits to be accepted without error.
- Module Random: added get_state and set_state to checkpoint the generator.
- Module Sys: signal handling functions are passed the system-independent
  signal number rather than the raw system signal number whenever possible.
- Module Weak: added Weak.get_copy.

Other libraries:
- Bigarray: added Bigarray.reshape to take a view of the elements of a
  bigarray with different dimensions or number of dimensions;
  fixed bug causing "get" operations to be unavailable in custom
  toplevels including Bigarray.
- Dynlink: raise an error instead of crashing when the loaded module
  refers to the not-yet-initialized module performing a dynlink operation.
- Bytecode threads: added a thread-safe version of the Marshal module;
    fixed a rare GC bug in the thread scheduler.
- POSIX threads: fixed compilation problem with threads.cmxa.
- Both thread libraries: better tail-recursion in Event.sync.
- Num library: fixed bug in square roots (Nat.sqrt_nat, Big_int.sqrt_big_int).

Tools:
- ocamldep: fixed missing dependencies on labels of record patterns and
    record construction operations

Win32 port:
- Unix.waitpid now implements the WNOHANG option.

Mac OS ports:
- Mac OS X public beta is supported.
- Int64.format works on Mac OS 8/9.

- Syntactic change: "?" in stream error handlers changed to "??".
- Added exception renaming in structures (exception E = F).
- (OCaml 2.99/OLabl users only) Label syntax changed to preserve
  backward compatibility with 2.0x (labeled function application
  is f ~lbl:arg instead of f lbl:arg).  A tool is provided to help
  convert labelized programs to OCaml 3.00.

Both compilers:
- Option -labels to select commuting label mode (labels are mandatory,
  but labeled arguments can be passed in a different order than in
  the definition of the function; in default mode, labels may be omitted,
  but argument reordering is only allowed for optional arguments).
- Libraries (.cma and .cmxa files) now "remember" C libraries given
  at library construction time, and add them back at link time.
  Allows linking with e.g. just unix.cma instead of

- Revised printing of error messages, now use Format.fprintf; no visible
  difference for users, but could facilitate internationalization later.
- Fixed bug in unboxing of records containing only floats.
- Fixed typing bug involving applicative functors as components of modules.

Standard library:
- New modules Int32, Int64, Nativeint for 32-bit, 64-bit and
  platform-native integers

  arbitrary heap-allocated data.
- Module Hashtbl: do not bomb when resizing very large table.
- Module Lazy: raise Lazy.Undefined when a lazy evaluation needs itself.
- Module List: added List.sort, List.stable_sort; fixed bug in List.rev_map2.

- Module Sort: still here but deprecated in favor of new sorting functions
  in Array and List.
- Module Stack: added Stack.top
- Module String: fixed boundary condition on String.rindex_from
- Added labels on function arguments where appropriate.

New libraries and tools:
- ocamlbrowser: graphical browser for OCaml sources and compiled interfaces,

- LablTK: GUI toolkit based on TK, using labeled and optional arguments,
  easier to use than CamlTK.
- Bigarray: large, multi-dimensional numerical arrays, facilitate
  interfacing with C/Fortran numerical code, efficient support for
  advanced array operations such as slicing and memory-mapping of files.

Other libraries:
- Bytecode threads: timer-based preemption was broken, works back again;
  fixed bug in Pervasives.input_line; exported Thread.yield.
- System threads: several GC / reentrancy bugs fixed in buffered I/O
  and Unix I/O; revised Thread.join implementation for strict POSIX
  conformance; exported Thread.yield.
- Graphics: added support for double buffering; added, current_x, current_y,
  rmoveto, rlineto, and draw_rect.

  - MIPS: fixed wrong asm generated for String.length "literal".

* Standard library:
  - Added the "ignore" primitive function, which just throws away its
    argument and returns "()".  It allows to write
    "ignore(f x); y" if "f x" doesn't have type unit and you don't
    want the warning caused by "f x; y".

* The graphics library:
  - Bypass color lookup for 16 bpp and 32 bpp direct-color displays.

  - Native threads: fixed GC bugs and installation procedure.
  - Bytecode threads: fixed problem with "Marshal" module.
  - Both: added Event.always.

* MS Windows port: better handling of long command lines in Sys.command

Objective Caml 1.06 (18 Nov 1997):
----------------------------------

* Language:
  - Added two new keywords: "assert" (check assertion) and "lazy"
    (delay evaluation).
  - Allow identifiers to start with "_" (such identifiers are treated
    as lowercase idents).

* Objects:
  - Added "protected" methods (visible only from subclasses, can be hidden
    in class type declared in module signature).
  - Objects can be compared using generic comparison functions.
  - Fixed compilation of partial application of object constructors.

* Type system:
  - Occur-check now more strict (all recursions must traverse an object).
  - A few bugs fixed.

* Run-time system:
  - A heap compactor was implemented, so long-running programs can now
    fight fragmentation.
  - The meaning of the "space_overhead" parameter has changed.
  - The macros Push_roots and Pop_roots are superseded by Begin_roots* and
    End_roots.
  - Bytecode executable includes list of primitives used, avoids crashes
    on version mismatch.
  - Reduced startup overhead for marshalling, much faster marshalling of
    small objects.
  - New exception Stack_overflow distinct from Out_of_memory.
  - Maximum stack size configurable.
  - I/O revised for compatibility with compactor and with native threads.
  - All C code ANSIfied (new-style function declarations, etc).
  - Threaded code work on all 64-bit processors, not just Alpha/Digital Unix.
  - Better printing of uncaught exceptions.

* Both compilers:
  - Parsing: more detailed reporting of syntax errors (e.g. shows
    unmatched opening parenthesis on missing closing parenthesis).
  - Check consistency between interfaces (.cmi).
  - Revised rules for determining dependencies between modules.
  - Options "-verbose" for printing calls to C compiler, "-noassert"
    for turning assertion checks off.

* Native-code compiler:
  - Machine-dependent parts rewritten using inheritance instead of
    parameterized modules.
  - GC bug in value let rec fixed.
  - Port to Linux/Alpha.
  - Sparc: cleaned up use of %g registers, now compatible with Solaris threads.

* Standard library:
  - New library module: Lazy (delayed computations).
  - New library module: Marshal.  Allows marshalling to strings and
    transmission of closures between identical programs (SPMD parallelism).
  - Filename: "is_absolute" is superseded by "is_implicit" and "is_relative".
    To adapt old programs, change "is_absolute x" to "not (is_implicit x)"
    (but the new "is_relative" is NOT the opposite of the old "is_absolute").
  - Array, Hashtbl, List, Map, Queue, Set, Stack, Stream:
    the "iter" functions now take as argument a unit-returning function.
  - Format: added "printf" interface to the formatter (see the documentation).
    Revised behaviour of simple boxes: no more than one new line is output
    when consecutive break hints should lead to multiple line breaks.
  - Stream: revised implementation, renamed Parse_failure to Failure and
    Parse_error to Error (don't you love gratuitous changes?).
  - String: added index, rindex, index_from, rindex_from.
  - Array: added mapi, iteri, fold_left, fold_right, init.
  - Added Map.map, Set.subset, Printexc.to_string.

* ocamllex: lexers generated by ocamllex can now handle all characters,
  including '\000'.

* ocamlyacc: fixed bug with function closures returned by parser rules.

* Debugger:
  - Revised generation of events.
  - Break on function entrance.
  - New commands start/previous.
  - The command loadprinter now try to recursively load required
    modules.
  - Numerous small fixes.

* External libraries:
  - systhreads: can now use POSIX threads; POSIX and Win32 threads are
    now supported by the native-code compiler.
  - dbm and graph: work in native code.
  - num: fixed bug in Nat.nat_of_string.
  - str: fixed deallocation bug with case folding.
  - win32unix: use Win32 handles instead of (buggy) VC++ emulation of Unix
    file handles; added gettimeofday.

    and hash functions); rehash when resizing, avoid memory leak on
    Hashtbl.remove.
  - Added Char.uppercase, Char.lowercase, String.uppercase, String.lowercase,
    String.capitalize, String.uncapitalize.
  - New module Weak for manipulating weak pointers.
  - New module Callback for registering closures and exceptions to be

  - bug with type names escaping their scope via unification with
    non-generalized type variables '_a completely fixed;
  - fixed bug in occur check : it was too restrictive;

  - "#install_printer" works again;
  - fixed bug in printing of subtyping errors;
  - in class interfaces, construct "method m" (without type) change
    the status of method m from abstract to concrete;
  - in a recursive definition of class interfaces, a class can now
    inherit from a previous class;
  - typing of a method make use of an eventual previously given type
    of this method, yielding clearer type errors.

* Compilation (ocamlc and ocamlopt):
  - fixed bug in compilation of classes.

* Native-code compilation:
  - optimization of functions taking tuples of arguments;
  - code emitter for the Motorola 680x0 processors (retrocomputing week);

* Perl-free, cpp-free, cholesterol-free installation procedure.


Objective Caml 1.02 (27 Sep 1996):
----------------------------------

* Typing:
  - fixed bug with type names escaping their scope via unification
    with non-generalized type variables '_a;
  - keep #class abbreviations longer;
  - faster checking of well-formed abbreviation definitions;
  - stricter checking of "with" constraints over signatures (arity
    mismatch, overriding of an already manifest type).

* Compilation (ocamlc and ocamlopt):
  - fixed bug in compilation of recursive classes;
  - [|...|] and let...rec... allowed inside definitions of recursive
    data structures;

* Bytecode compilation: fixed overflow in linker for programs with
  more than 65535 globals and constants.

* Native-code compilation:
  - ocamlopt ported to HPPA under HP/UX, Intel x86 under Solaris 2,
    PowerMacintosh under MkLinux;
  - fixed two bugs related to floating-point arrays (one with "t array"
    where t is an abstract type implemented as float, one with
    comparison between two float arrays on 32 bit platforms);
  - fixed reloading/spilling problem causing non-termination of
    register allocation;

  - fixed reloading bug in indirect calls.

* Windows NT/95 port:
  - complete port of the threads library (Pascal Cuoq);
  - partial port of the Unix library (Pascal Cuoq);
  - expansion of *, ? and @ on the command line.

* Standard library:
  - bug in in List.exists2 fixed;
  - bug in "Random.int n" for very large n on 64-bit machines fixed;
  - module Format: added a "general purpose" type of box (open_box);
    can output on several formatters at the same time.

* The "threads" library:
  - implementation on top of native threads available for Win32 and
    POSIX 1003.1c;
  - added -thread option to select a thread-safe version of the
    standard library, the ThreadIO module is no longer needed.

* The "graph" library: avoid invalid pixmaps when doing
  open_graph/close_graph several times.

* The "dynlink" library: support for "private" (no re-export) dynamic loading.

* ocamlyacc: skip '...' character literals correctly.

* C interface: C code linked with O'Caml code can provide its own main()
  and call caml_main() later.


Objective Caml 1.01 (12 Jun 1996):
----------------------------------

* Typing: better report of type incompatibilities;
  non-generalizable type variables in a struct...end no longer flagged
  immediately as an error;
  name clashes during "open" avoided.

* Fixed bug in output_value where identical data structures
  could have different external representations; this bug caused wrong
  "inconsistent assumptions" errors when checking compatibility of
  interfaces at link-time.

* Standard library: fixed bug in Array.blit on overlapping array sections

* Unmarshaling from strings now working.

* ocamlc, ocamlopt: new flags -intf and -impl to force compilation as

* ocamlc: fixed bytecode generation bug causing problems with compilation
  units defining more than 256 values

* ocamlopt, all platforms:
  fixed GC bug in "let rec" over data structures;
  link startup file first, fixes "undefined symbol" errors with some
  libraries.

* ocamlopt, Intel x86:
  more efficient calling sequence for calling C functions;
  floating-point wars, chapter 5: don't use float stack for holding
  float pseudo-registers, stack-allocating them is just as efficient.

* ocamlopt, Alpha and Intel x86: more compact calling sequence for garbage
  collection.

* ocamllex: generated automata no longer use callbacks for refilling
  the input buffer (works better with threads); character literals
  correctly skipped inside actions.

* ocamldep: "-I" directories now searched in the right order

* Thread library: incompatibilities with callbacks, signals, and
  dynamic linking removed; scheduling bug with Thread.wait fixed.

* New "dbm" library, interfaces with NDBM.

* Object-oriented extensions:
    instance variables can now be omitted in class types;
    some error messages have been made clearer;
    several bugs fixes.

Objective Caml 1.00 (9 May 1996):
---------------------------------

* Merge of Jérôme Vouillon and Didier Rémy's object-oriented
extensions.

avoid code size explosion.

* Compiler support for preprocessing source files (-pp flag).

* Library construction: flag -linkall to force linking of all units in
a library.

Caml Special Light 1.15 (15 Mar 1996):
--------------------------------------

* Caml Special Light now runs under Windows NT and 95. Many thanks to
Kevin Gallo (Microsoft Research) who contributed his initial port.

The resulting lexers are smaller and run faster.

* Completely automatic configuration script.

* Typing: more stringent checking of module type definitions against
manifest module type specifications.

* Toplevel: recursive definitions of values now working.

* Native-code compiler, all platforms:
        toplevel "let"s with refutable patterns now working;
        fixed bug in assignment to float record fields;
        direct support for floating-point negation and absolute value.

* Native-code compiler, x86: fixed bug with tail calls (with more than
4 arguments) from a function with a one-word stack frame.

* Native-code compiler, Sparc: problem with -compact fixed.

* Thread library: support for non-blocking writes; scheduler revised.

* Unix library: bug in gethostbyaddr fixed; bounds checking for read,
write, etc.

Caml Special Light 1.14 (8 Feb 1996):
-------------------------------------

AIX in the bytecode system as well.

* cslopt, all platforms: fixed bug in live range splitting around catch/exit.

* cslopt for the Intel (floating-point wars, chapter 4):
implemented Ershov's algorithm to minimize floating-point stack usage;
out-of-order pops fixed.

* Several bug fixes in callbacks and signals.

Caml Special Light 1.13 (4 Jan 1996):
-------------------------------------

* Pattern-matching compilation revised to factor out accesses inside
matched structures.

* Callbacks and signals now supported in cslopt.
Signals are only detected at allocation points, though.
Added callback functions with 2 and 3 arguments.

* More explicit error messages when a native-code program aborts due
to array or string bound violations.

* In patterns, "C _" allowed even if the constructor C has several arguments.

* && and || allowed as alternate syntax for & and or.

* cslopt for the Intel: code generation for floating-point
operations entirely redone for the third time (a pox on whomever at
Intel decided to organize the floating-point registers as a stack).

* cslopt for the Sparc: don't use Sparc V8 smul and sdiv instructions,
emulation on V7 processors is abysmal.

Caml Special Light 1.12 (30 Nov 1995):
--------------------------------------

* Fixed an embarrassing bug with references to floats.

Caml Special Light 1.11 (29 Nov 1995):
--------------------------------------

* Streams and stream parsers a la Caml Light are back (thanks to
Daniel de Rauglaudre).

* User-level concurrent threads, with low-level shared memory primitives
(locks and conditions) as well as channel-based communication primitives
with first-class synchronous events, in the style of Reppy's CML.

* The native-code compiler has been ported to the HP PA-RISC processor
running under NextStep (sorry, no HPUX, its linker keeps dumping
core on me).

* References not captured in a function are optimized into variables.

* Fixed several bugs related to exceptions.

* Floats behave a little more as specified in the IEEE standard
(believe it or not, but x < y is not the negation of x >= y).

* Lower memory consumption for the native-code compiler.

Caml Special Light 1.10 (07 Nov 1995):
--------------------------------------

* Many bug fixes (too many to list here).

* Module language: introduction of a "with module" notation over
signatures for concise sharing of all type components of a signature;
better support for concrete types in signatures.

* Native-code compiler: the Intel 386 version has been ported to
NextStep and FreeBSD, and generates better code (especially for
floats)

* Tools and libraries: the Caml Light profiler and library for
arbitrary-precision arithmetic have been ported (thanks to John
Malecki and Victor Manuel Gulias Fernandez); better docs for the Unix
and regexp libraries.

Caml Special Light 1.07 (20 Sep 1995):
