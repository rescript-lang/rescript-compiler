(* Note that currently there is no way to consume [Js.meth_callback]
    so it is fine to encode it with a freedom, 
    but we need make it better for error message.
    - all are encoded as 
    {[ 
      type fn =  (`Args_n of _ , 'result ) Js.fn
      type method = (`Args_n of _, 'result) Js.method
      type method_callback = (`Args_n of _, 'result) Js.method_callback
    ]}
    For [method_callback], the arity is never zero, so both [method] 
    and  [fn] requires (unit -> 'a) to encode arity zero
