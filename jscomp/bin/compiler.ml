let mul x y = x * y   (* caml_mul | Math.imul *)

]}


Note that js treat unsigned shift 0 bits in a special way
   Unsigned shifts convert their left-hand side to Uint32, 
   signed shifts convert it to Int32.
   Shifting by 0 digits returns the converted value.
   {[
    function ToUint32(x) {
        return x >>> 0;
    }
    function ToInt32(x) {
        return x >> 0;
    }
   ]}
   So in Js, [-1 >>>0] will be the largest Uint32, while [-1>>0] will remain [-1]
   and [-1 >>> 0 >> 0 ] will be [-1]

There are two things we need consider:
1.  For some primitives we can replace caml-primitive with js primitives directly
2.  For some standard library functions, we prefer to replace with javascript primitives
    For example [Pervasives["^"] -> ^]
    We can collect all mli files in OCaml and replace it with an efficient javascript runtime

    A naive beta reduce would break the invariants of the optmization.


    The sane but slowest  way:
      when we do a beta reduction, we need rename all variables inlcuding 
      let-bound ones

    A conservative one:
      - for internal one 
        rename params and let bound variables
      - for external one (seriaized)
        if it's enclosed environment should be good enough
        so far, we only inline enclosed lambdas

(**
   This pass would do beta reduction, and dead code elimination (adapted from compiler's built-in [Simplif] module )

   1. beta reduction -> Llet (Strict )
  
   2. The global table [occ] associates to each let-bound identifier
   the number of its uses (as a reference):
     - 0 if never used
     - 1 if used exactly once in and *not under a lambda or within a loop
     - > 1 if used several times or under a lambda or within a loop.

   The local table [bv] associates to each locally-let-bound variable
   its reference count, as above.  [bv] is enriched at let bindings
   but emptied when crossing lambdas and loops. 

   For this pass, when it' used under a lambda or within a loop, we don't do anything,
   in theory, we can still do something if it's pure but we are conservative here.

   [bv] is used to help caculate [occ] it is not useful outside

(** This pass is used to collect meta data information.

    It includes:
    alias table, arity for identifiers and might more information,
    
    ATTENTION:
    For later pass to keep its information complete and up to date,
    we  need update its table accordingly

    - Alias inference is not for substitution, it is for analyze which module is 
      actually a global module or an exception, so it can be relaxed a bit
      (without relying on strict analysis)

    - Js object (local) analysis 

    Design choice:

    Side effectful operations:
       - Lassign 
       - Psetfield

    1. What information should be collected:

    2. What's the key
       If it's identifier, 
       
    Information that is always sound, not subject to change 

    - shall we collect that if an identifier is passed as a parameter, (useful for escape analysis), 
    however, since it's going to change after inlning (for local function)

    - function arity, subject to change when you make it a mutable ref and change it later
    
    - Immutable blocks of identifiers
     
      if identifier itself is function/non block then the access can be inlined 
      if identifier itself is immutable block can be inlined
      if identifier is mutable block can be inlined (without Lassign) since

    - When collect some information, shall we propogate this information to 
      all alias table immeidately

      - annotation identifiers (at first time)
      -

   TODO: enrich ast to support import export 
   http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-imports
   For every module, we need [Ident.t] for accessing and [filename] for import, 
   they are not necessarily the same.

   Es6 modules is not the same with commonjs, we use commonjs currently
   (play better with node)

   FIXME: the module order matters?

       in the outerloop and captured by the inner loop, 
       it still has to be lexically scoped. 

       How do we detect whether it is loop invariant or not 
       - depend on loop variant 
       - depend on mutuable valuse
       - non pure (function call)

       so we need collect mutable variables 
       1. from lambda + loop (for/i) + tailcall params
       2. defined in the loop and can not determine it is invariant  
          in such cases we can determine it's immutable
          1. const 
          2. only depend on immutable values and no function call?

    ## The following would take advantage of nested loops 
    2. loop invariant observable varaibles 
        {[ 
         var x = (console.log(3), 32)
        ]}
    3. loop invariant non-observable variables 

    Invariant: 
    loop invariant (observable or not) variables can not depend on 
    loop mutable values so that once we detect loop Invariant variables 
    all its dependency are loop invariant as well, so we can do loop 
    Invariant code motion.
    
    TODO:
    loop invariant can be layered, it will be loop invariant 
    in the inner layer while loop variant in the outer layer.

(** A pass converting nested js statement into a flatten visual appearance 

    Note this module is used to convert some nested expressions to flat statements, 
    in general, it's more human readable, and since it generate flat statements, we can spot
    some inline opportunities for the produced statemetns, 
    (inline) expressions inside a nested expression would generate ugly code.

    Since we are aiming to flatten expressions, we should avoid some smart constructors in {!Js_helper}, 
    it  tries to spit out expression istead of statements if it can
