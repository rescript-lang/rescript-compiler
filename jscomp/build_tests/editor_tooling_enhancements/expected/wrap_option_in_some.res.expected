  This pattern matches values of type [1;31mint[0m
  but a pattern was expected which matches values of type [1;33moption<int>[0m
  
  The value you're pattern matching on here is wrapped in an [1;33moption[0m, but you're trying to match on the actual value.
  Wrap the highlighted pattern in [1;33mSome()[0m to make it work.
