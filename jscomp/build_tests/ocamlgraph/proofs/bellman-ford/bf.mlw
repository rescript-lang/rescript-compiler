  lemma path_in_vertices:
    forall v1 v2: vertex, l: list vertex.
    mem v1 vertices -> path v1 l v2 -> mem v2 vertices

  (* A key idea behind Bellman-Ford's correctness is that of simple path:
     if there is a path from s to v, there is a path with less than
     |V| edges. We formulate this in a slightly more precise way: if there
     a path from s to v with at least |V| edges, then there must be a duplicate
     vertex along this path. There is a subtlety here: since the last vertex
     of a path is not part of the vertex list, we distinguish the case where
     the duplicate vertex is the final vertex v.

     Proof: Assume [path s l v] with length l >= |V|.
       Consider the function f mapping i in {0..|V|} to the i-th element
       of the list l ++ [v]. Since all elements of the
       path (those in l and v) belong to V, then by the pigeon hole principle,
       f cannot be injective from 0..|V| to V. Thus there exist two distinct
       i and j in 0..|V| such that f(i)=f(j), which means that
              l ++ [v] = l1 ++ [u] ++ l2 ++ [u] ++ l3
       Two cases depending on l3=[] (and thus u=v) conclude the proof. Qed.

  lemma long_path_decomposition:
    forall l: list vertex, v: vertex.
    path s l v -> length l >= cardinal vertices ->
       (exists l1 l2: list vertex. l = l1 ++ Cons v l2)
    \/ (exists n: vertex, l1 l2 l3: list vertex.
          l = l1 ++ Cons n (l2 ++ Cons n l3))

  lemma simple_path:
    forall v: vertex, l: list vertex. path s l v ->
    exists l': list vertex. path s l' v /\ length l' < cardinal vertices

  (* negative cycle [v] -> [v] reachable from [s] *)
  predicate negative_cycle (v: vertex) =
    mem v vertices /\
    (exists l1: list vertex. path s l1 v) /\
    (exists l2: list vertex. path v l2 v /\ path_weight l2 v < 0)

  (* key lemma for existence of a negative cycle

     Proof: by induction on the (list) length of the shorter path l
       If length l < cardinal vertices, then it contradicts hypothesis 1
       thus length l >= cardinal vertices and thus the path contains a cycle
             s ----> n ----> n ----> v
       If the weight of the cycle n--->n is negative, we are done.
       Otherwise, we can remove this cycle from the path and we get
       an even shorter path, with a stricltly shorter (list) length,
       thus we can apply the induction hypothesis.                     Qed.

  (* key lemma for non-existence of a negative cycle

     Proof: let us assume a negative cycle reachable from s, that is
         s --...--> x0 --w1--> x1 --w2--> x2 ... xn-1 --wn--> x0
       with w1+w2+...+wn < 0.
       Let di be the distance from s to xi as given by map m.
       By [inv2 m edges] we have di-1 + wi >= di for all i.
       Summing all such inequalities over the cycle, we get
            w1+w2+...+wn >= 0
