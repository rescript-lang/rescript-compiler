* marks some incompatible change

version 1.8.7, April 12, 2016
-----------------------------
 o fixed examples/demo.ml so that it also compiles with an installed OCamlGraph
 o [Components] fixed stack overflow with [scc] (patch by Albin Coquereau)
 o [Dominator] fixed stack overflow (patch by Albin Coquereau)
 o new functor [Path.Johnson] to compute all pairs of shortest paths
   using Johnson's algorithm (contributed by Mário Pereira)
 o fixed configuration on Windows (patch by Martin R. Neuhäußer)
 o new functor [Components.Undirected] to compute connected components
 o Graphviz: fixed printing of attribute BgcolorWithTransparency
 * Prim, Nonnegative: function weight now has the more general type "edge -> t"
   (to be consistent with Path)
 o new module type Sig.WEIGHT (used in Path, Prim, and Nonnegative)
 o Fixpoint: do not catch Not_found raised by a user-provided function.
 o Adding folds to BFS.

version 1.8.6, January 23, 2015
-------------------------------
 * Dominator: new functor [Make_graph] with may use graph building operations,
   while the old functor [Make] now only requires a read-only graph.
   Function [compute_all] and [compute_dom_graph] are now only defined in the
   new [Make_graph] functor.
 o Graphviz: support for additional polygonal-shapes
 o New module Clique (contributed by Giselle Reis)
 o Avoid ocamldoc error with OCaml 4.02
 * Path: function weight now has the more general type "edge -> t"
   (contributed by Steffen Smolka)
   update your code by turning "weight l" into "weight (G.E.label e)"
 o installation: "make install-findlib" now uses DESTDIR when defined
 o Traverse: documentation is clarified: providing iterators over the roots of
   the graph is enough.
 o Imperative concreate (di)graph: fix bug of functions add_edge* of imperative
   concrete (di)graphs which appears when the added edge [e] was already in the
   graph [g] and one of the vertices of [e] is equal to another vertex of [g]
   (when using the user-defined equality [G.V.equal]), but not physically equal
   to it. This bug only occurs with OCaml version >= 4.0.
 o functions in modules Components, Dominator, Flow, Topological and Traverse
   now create smaller auxiliary hash tables
 o Graphviz: add the attribute `HtmlLabel to specify html strings.

version 1.8.5, March 4, 2014
-----------------------------
 o Graphviz: reverted to the old API where edges and vertices are
   given a single style attribute; but such attributes are collected
   and output in the DOT file into a list (thus allowing multiple style
   attributes)
 o fixed issue in ./configure with ocamlfind on Win32.
 o fixed compilation when laglgnomecanvas is missing (bug introduced in 1.8.4).
 o fixed more issues with 'make -j'.

version 1.8.4, February 4, 2014
-------------------------------
 o fixed [Graphml] printer (contributed by Johannes Schauer)
 o Components: the components of [scc_list] are provided in the same order than
 the ones of [scc_array].
 o fix compilation with 'make -j'
 o Graphviz: handle attribute penwidth on edges and vertices
 o also install graph.o and graph.cmxs
 o fixed installation with ocamlfind (thanks to Virgile Prevosto)
 o new functions [gnp] and [gnp_labeled] in module [Rand] to generate random
   graphs using the G(n,p) model (contributed by Thomas Aubry)
 o Prim's algorithm (in module [Prim]; not exported in [Pack])
   (contributed by Thomas Aubry)
 o Graphviz: support for nested subgraphs. (Backward-incompatible change:
   add 'sg_parent = None' to obtain subgraphs whose parents are the main graph)
 o Graphviz: edges and vertices can now receive multiple styles.
   (Backward-incompatible change: constructors `Style now require a list as
   argument)
 o Graphviz: new vertex style 'rounded'
 o Merge: fixed bug with vertices with no incoming nor outcoming edge.
 o fixed compilation issue with OCaml 3.12.1

version 1.8.3, April 17, 2013

   (contributed by David Brumley and Ivan Jager)

 o new module Contraction implementing edge contraction
   (contributed by Markus W. Weissmann)

   compatibility: the input graph must implement Sig.COMPARABLE instead of
   Sig.HASHABLE
 o new module Topological.Make_stable to iterate over a graph in a **stable**
   topological order. Stable means that the provided ordering only depends on
   the graph topology and on the user's vertices ordering.
 o new module Leaderlist to compute the leader list algorithm (see the Dragon)
   (contributed by Markus W. Weissmann <markus.weissmann@in.tum.de>)

version 1.8.1, October 17, 2011
-------------------------------
 o module Gmap now has a signature for edges (E_SRC) compatible with
   Sig, so that it is easier to apply functor Gmap.Edge
   (contributed by Markus W. Weissmann <markus.weissmann@in.tum.de>)

   algorithm, e.g. for data flow analysis
