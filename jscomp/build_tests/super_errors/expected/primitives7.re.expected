  1 [2m│[0m /* Wanted list(float), found list(int) */
  2 [2m│[0m let a = [1,2,3];
  [1;31m3[0m [2m│[0m List.map(((n) => n +. 2.), [1;31ma[0m);
  
  This has type:
    [1;31mlist(int)[0m
  But somewhere wanted:
    [1;33mlist(float)[0m
  
  The incompatible parts:
    [1;31mint[0m
    vs
    [1;33mfloat[0m

You can convert a [1;33mint[0m to a [1;33mfloat[0m with [1;33mfloat_of_int[0m.If this is a literal, you want a number with a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20.[0m).
