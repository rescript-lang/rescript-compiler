  1 [2m│[0m /* Wrong constructor argument */
  2 [2m│[0m type x = X(int, float);
  [1;31m3[0m [2m│[0m X(10, [1;31m10[0m);
  
  This has type:
    [1;31mint[0m
  But somewhere wanted:
    [1;33mfloat[0m

You can convert a [1;33mint[0m to a [1;33mfloat[0m with [1;33mfloat_of_int[0m.If this is a literal, you want a number with a trailing dot (e.g. [1;33m20.[0m).
