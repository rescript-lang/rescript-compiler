(** Provides functions for inspecting and maniplating native JavaScript objects
*)

(** [empty ()] returns the empty object [\{\}] *)
external empty : unit -> < .. > Js.t = "" [@@bs.obj]

(** [assign target source] copies properties from [source] to [target]

Properties in [target] will be overwritten by properties in [source] if they
have the same key.

{b Returns} [target]

@example {[
(* Copy an object *)

let obj = [%obj { a = 1 }]

let copy = Js.Obj.assign (Js.Obj.empty ()) obj

(* prints "{ a: 1 }" *)
let _ = Js.log copy
]}

@example {[
(* Merge objects with same properties *)

let target = [%obj { a = 1; b = 1; }]
let source = [%obj { b = 2; }]

let obj = Js.Obj.assign target source

(* prints "{ a: 1, b: 2 }" *)
let _ = Js.log obj

(* prints "{ a: 1, b: 2 }", target is modified *)
let _ = Js.log target
]}

Should we map this API as directly as possible, provide some abstractions, or deliberately nerf it?
