  (* #1556
     Note the main difference between [Ml] and [Runtime] is
     that we have more assumptions about [Runtime] module,
     like its purity etc, and its name uniqueues, in the pattern match
     {[
       {Runtime, "caml_int_compare"}
     ]}
     and we could do more optimziations.
     However, here if it is [hit]
     (an Ml module = an Runtime module), which means both exists,
     so adding either does not matter
     if it is not hit, fine
