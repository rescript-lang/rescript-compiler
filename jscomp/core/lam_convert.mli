  it also collect [exit_map] and a collection of potential depended modules [may_depends]
  In this pass we also synchronized aliases so that 
    {[
      let a1 = a0 in 
      let a2 = a1 in 
      let a3 = a2 in 
      let a4 = a3 in

      let a2 = a0 in 
      let a3 = a0 in 
      let a4 = a0 in 
    ]}
    we dont eliminate unused let bindings to leave it for {!Lam_pass_lets_dce}
    we should remove all those let aliases, otherwise, it will be
    pushed into alias table again
