   construct array,
   set array,
   ref array,

   Also make sure, don't call any primitive array method, i.e [E.array_index_by_int] 

   We also need check primitive [caml_make_vect], i.e, 
   [Caml_primitive['caml_make_vect']] see if it's correct 

   [caml_make_vect]
   [caml_array_sub]
   [caml_array_append]
   [caml_array_concat]
   [caml_make_float_vect]
   [caml_array_blit]
