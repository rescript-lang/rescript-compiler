(** This pass is used to collect meta data information.

    It includes: alias table, arity for identifiers and might more information,

    ATTENTION: For later pass to keep its information complete and up to date,
    we need update its table accordingly

    {ul
     {- Alias inference is not for substitution, it is for analyze which module
        is actually a global module or an exception, so it can be relaxed a bit
        (without relying on strict analysis)}}

    - Js object (local) analysis

    Design choice:

    Side effectful operations:
    - Lassign
    - Psetfield

    1. What information should be collected:

    2. What's the key If it's identifier,

    Information that is always sound, not subject to change

    - shall we collect that if an identifier is passed as a parameter, (useful
      for escape analysis), however, since it's going to change after inlning
      (for local function)

    - function arity, subject to change when you make it a mutable ref and
      change it later

    - Immutable blocks of identifiers

    if identifier itself is function/non block then the access can be inlined
    if identifier itself is immutable block can be inlined if identifier is
    mutable block can be inlined (without Lassign) since

    {ul
     {- When collect some information, shall we propogate this information to
        all alias table immeidately}}

    - annotation identifiers (at first time)
