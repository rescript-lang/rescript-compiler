   when we do optmizations, we might need track it will break invariant 
   of other optimizations, especially for [mutable] meta data, 
   for example, this pass will break [closure] information, 
   it should be done before closure pass (even it does not use closure information)

   Take away, it is really hard to change the code while collecting some information..
   we should always collect info in a single pass

   Note that, we should avoid reuse object, i.e,
   {[
     let v = 
       object 
       end      
   ]}   
   Since user may use `bsc.exe -c xx.ml xy.ml xz.ml` and we need clean up state
*)

(** we can do here, however, we should 
    be careful that it can only be done 
    when it's accessed once and the array is not escaped,
    otherwise, we redo the computation,
    or even better, we re-order

    {[
      var match = [/* tuple */0,Pervasives.string_of_int(f(1,2,3)),f3(2),arr];

          var a = match[1];

            var b = match[2];

    ]}

    --->

    {[
      var match$1 = Pervasives.string_of_int(f(1,2,3));

                      var arr = arr; 
    ]}

    --> 
    since match$1 (after match is eliminated) is only called once 
    {[
      var a = Pervasives.string_of_int(f(1,2,3));
      var b = f3(2);
