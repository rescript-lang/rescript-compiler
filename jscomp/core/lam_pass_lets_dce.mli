val simplify_lets : Lam.t -> Lam.t
(** This pass would do beta reduction, and dead code elimination (adapted from
    compiler's built-in [Simplif] module )

    1. beta reduction -> Llet (Strict )

    2. The global table [occ] associates to each let-bound identifier the
    number of its uses (as a
    reference):
    - 0 if never used
    - 1 if used exactly once in and *not under a lambda or within a loop
    - > 1 if used several times or under a lambda or within a loop.

    The local table [bv] associates to each locally-let-bound variable its
    reference count, as above. [bv] is enriched at let bindings but emptied
    when crossing lambdas and loops.

    For this pass, when it' used under a lambda or within a loop, we don't do
    anything, in theory, we can still do something if it's pure but we are
    conservative here.

    [bv] is used to help caculate [occ] it is not useful outside *)
