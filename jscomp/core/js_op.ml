note that we don't need raise [Div_by_zero] in BuckleScript

{[
let add x y = x + y  (* | 0 *)
let minus x y = x - y (* | 0 *)
let mul x y = x * y   (* caml_mul | Math.imul *)
let div x y = x / y (* caml_div (x/y|0)*)
let imod x y = x mod y  (* caml_mod (x%y) (zero_divide)*)

let bor x y = x lor y   (* x  | y *)
let bxor x y = x lxor y (* x ^ y *)
let band x y = x land y (* x & y *)
let ilnot  y  = lnot y (* let lnot x = x lxor (-1) *)
let ilsl x y = x lsl y (* x << y*)
let ilsr x y = x lsr y  (* x >>> y | 0 *)
let iasr  x y = x asr y (* x >> y *)
]}


Note that js treat unsigned shift 0 bits in a special way
   Unsigned shifts convert their left-hand side to Uint32, 
   signed shifts convert it to Int32.
   Shifting by 0 digits returns the converted value.
   {[
    function ToUint32(x) {
        return x >>> 0;
    }
    function ToInt32(x) {
        return x >> 0;
    }
   ]}
   So in Js, [-1 >>>0] will be the largest Uint32, while [-1>>0] will remain [-1]
   and [-1 >>> 0 >> 0 ] will be [-1]
