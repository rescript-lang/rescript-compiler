(** Extensible buffers.

   This module implements buffers that automatically expand
   as necessary.  It provides accumulative concatenation of strings
   in quasi-linear time (instead of quadratic time when strings are
   concatenated pairwise).

type t
(** The abstract type of buffers. *)

val create : int -> t
(** [create n] returns a fresh buffer, initially empty.
   The [n] parameter is the initial size of the internal byte sequence
   that holds the buffer contents. That byte sequence is automatically
   reallocated when more than [n] characters are stored in the buffer,
   but shrinks back to [n] characters when [reset] is called.
   For best performance, [n] should be of the same order of magnitude
   as the number of characters that are expected to be stored in
   the buffer (for instance, 80 for a buffer that holds one output
   line).  Nothing bad will happen if the buffer grows beyond that
   limit, however. In doubt, take [n = 16] for instance.
   If [n] is not between 1 and {!Sys.max_string_length}, it will
   be clipped to that interval. *)

val contents : t -> string
(** Return a copy of the current contents of the buffer.
    The buffer itself is unchanged. *)

val length : t -> int
(** Return the number of characters currently contained in the buffer. *)

val clear : t -> unit
(** Empty the buffer. *)


val add_char : t -> char -> unit
(** [add_char b c] appends the character [c] at the end of the buffer [b]. *)

val add_string : t -> string -> unit
(** [add_string b s] appends the string [s] at the end of the buffer [b]. *)

val add_bytes : t -> bytes -> unit
(** [add_string b s] appends the string [s] at the end of the buffer [b].
    @since 4.02 *)

val add_substring : t -> string -> int -> int -> unit
(** [add_substring b s ofs len] takes [len] characters from offset
   [ofs] in string [s] and appends them at the end of the buffer [b]. *)

val add_subbytes : t -> bytes -> int -> int -> unit
(** [add_substring b s ofs len] takes [len] characters from offset
    [ofs] in byte sequence [s] and appends them at the end of the buffer [b].
    @since 4.02 *)

val add_buffer : t -> t -> unit
(** [add_buffer b1 b2] appends the current contents of buffer [b2]
   at the end of buffer [b1].  [b2] is not modified. *)    

val add_channel : t -> in_channel -> int -> unit
(** [add_channel b ic n] reads exactly [n] character from the
   input channel [ic] and stores them at the end of buffer [b].
   Raise [End_of_file] if the channel contains fewer than [n]
   characters. *)

val output_buffer : out_channel -> t -> unit
(** [output_buffer oc b] writes the current contents of buffer [b]
   on the output channel [oc]. *)
