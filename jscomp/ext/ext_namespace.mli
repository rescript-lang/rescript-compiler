(* Note  we have to output uncapitalized file Name, 
  or at least be consistent, since by reading cmi file on Case insensitive OS, we don't really know it is `list.cmi` or `List.cmi`, so that `require (./list.js)` or `require(./List.js)`
  relevant issues: #1609, #913  
  
  #1933 when removing ns suffix, don't pass the bound
