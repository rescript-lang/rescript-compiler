(** A simple pretty printer
    
    Advantage compared with [Format], 
    [P.newline] does not screw the layout, have better control when do a newline (sicne JS has ASI)
    Easy to tweak

    {ul 
    {- be a little smarter}
    {- buffer the last line, so that  we can do a smart newline, when it's really safe to do so}
