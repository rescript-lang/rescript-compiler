   same as {!Js_dump.ident} except it generates a string instead of doing the printing
   For fast/debug mode, we can generate the name as 
       [Printf.sprintf "%s$%d" name id.stamp] which is 
       not relevant to the context       

   Attention: 
   - $$Array.length, due to the fact that global module is 
       always printed in the begining(via imports), so you get a gurantee, 
       (global modules will not be printed as [List$1]) 

       However, this means we loose the ability of dynamic loading, is it a big 
       deal? we can fix this by a scanning first, since we already know which 
       modules are global

       check [test/test_global_print.ml] for regression
   - collision
      It is obvious that for the same identifier that they 
      print the same name.

      It also needs to be hold that for two different identifiers,  
      they print different names:
   - This happens when they escape to the same name and 
        share the  same stamp
      So the key has to be mangled name  + stamp
      otherwise, if two identifier happens to have same mangled name,
      if we use the original name as key, they can have same id (like 0).
      then it caused a collision

      Here we can guarantee that if mangled name and stamp are not all the same
      they can not have a collision
