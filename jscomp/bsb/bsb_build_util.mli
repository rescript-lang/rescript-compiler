(* The path of [bsc] and [bsdep] is normalized so that the invokation of [./jscomp/bin/bsb.exe] 
   and [bsb.exe] (combined with a dirty bsconfig.json) will not trigger unnecessary rebuild.
   
   The location of [bsc] and [bsdep] is configured by the combination of [Sys.executable_name] 
   and [cwd].
   
   In theory, we should also check the integrity of [bsb.exe], if it is changed, the rebuild 
   should be regen, but that is too much in practice, not only you need check the integrity of 
   path of [bsb.exe] but also the timestamp, to make it 100% correct, also the integrity of 
   [bsdep.exe] [bsc.exe] etc.

   if [Sys.executable_name] gives an absolute path,

   if it is a relative path 

   there are two cases: 
   - bsb.exe
   - ./bsb.exe 
   The first should also not be touched
   Only the latter need be adapted based on project root
