   If [Sys.executable_name] gives an absolute path,
   nothing needs to be done.

   If [Sys.executable_name] is not an absolute path, for example
   (rlwrap ./ocaml)
   it is a relative path,
   it needs be adapted based on cwd

   if [Sys.executable_name] gives an absolute path,
   nothing needs to be done
   if it is a relative path

   there are two cases:
   - bsb.exe
   - ./bsb.exe
   The first should also not be touched
   Only the latter need be adapted based on project root
