           \n\
           This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been\n\
           published from being rewound.\n\
           \n\
           The workflow assumed here is:\n\
           \n\
          \ * Once a topic branch forks from \"master\", \"master\" is never\n\
          \   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).\n\
           \n\
          \ * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into \"master\",\n\
          \   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct\n\
          \   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\n\
          \   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\n\
          \   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\n\
           \n\
          \ * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\n\
          \   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\n\
           \n\
           The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\n\
           to be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\n\
           $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\n\
           \n\
           With this workflow, you would want to know:\n\
           \n\
           (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\n\
          \    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n\
          \    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n\
          \    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n\
          \    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n\
          \    not want to rewind it.\n\
           \n\
           (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n\
          \    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n\
          \    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n\
          \    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n\
          \    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n\
          \    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n\
          \    tip of \"master\".\n\
           \n\
           Let's look at this example:\n\
           \n\
           \t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\

           \t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\
           \t\t/   /               /           /\n\
           \t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\
           \t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\
           \t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\
           \t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n\
          \    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\
           \n\
           \n\
           A, B and C are topic branches.\n\
           \n\
          \ * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\
           \n\
          \ * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n\
          \   and is ready to be deleted.\n\
           \n\
          \ * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\
           \n\
           We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\n\
           B to be deleted.\n\
