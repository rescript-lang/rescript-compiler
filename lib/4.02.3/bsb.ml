   but shrinks back to [n] characters when [reset] is called.
   For best performance, [n] should be of the same order of magnitude

       ## Run Project\n\
       \n\
       ```sh\n\
       npm install\n\
       npm start\n\
       # in another tab\n\
       npm run webpack\n\
       ```\n\
       \n\
       After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up `build/index.html` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever `.re` file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.\n\
       \n\
       **For more elaborate ReasonReact examples**, please see https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example\n\
       \n\
       ## Run Project with Server\n\
       \n\
       To run with the webpack development server run `npm run server` and view in the browser at http://localhost:8000. Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh.\n\
       \n\
       Note that any hot reload on a route will fall back to the root (`/`), so `ReasonReact.Router.dangerouslyGetInitialUrl` will likely be needed alongside the `ReasonReact.Router.watchUrl` logic to handle routing correctly on hot reload refreshes or simply opening the app at a URL that is not the root.\n\
       \n\
       To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).\n\
       \n\
       ## Build for Production\n\
       \n\
       ```sh\n\
       npm run clean\n\
       npm run build\n\
       npm run webpack:production\n\
       ```\n\
       \n\
       This will replace the development artifact `build/Index.js` for an optimized version as well as copy `src/index.html` into `build/`. You can then deploy the contents of the `build` directory (`index.html` and `Index.js`).\n\
       \n\
       If you make use of routing (via `ReasonReact.Router` or similar logic) ensure that server-side routing handles your routes or that 404's are directed back to `index.html` (which is how the dev server is set up).\n\
       \n\
       **To enable dead code elimination**, change `bsconfig.json`'s `package-specs` `module` from `\"commonjs\"` to `\"es6\"`. Then re-run the above 2 commands. This will allow Webpack to remove unused code.\n\

       ## Run Project\n\
       \n\
       ```sh\n\
       npm install\n\
       npm start\n\
       # in another tab\n\
       npm run webpack\n\
       ```\n\
       \n\
       After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run webpack` step), open up `build/index.html` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever `.re` file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.\n\
       \n\
       **For more elaborate ReasonReact examples**, please see https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-example\n\
       \n\
       ## Run Project with Server\n\
       \n\
       To run with the webpack development server run `npm run server` and view in the browser at http://localhost:8000. Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh.\n\
       \n\
       Note that any hot reload on a route will fall back to the root (`/`), so `ReasonReact.Router.dangerouslyGetInitialUrl` will likely be needed alongside the `ReasonReact.Router.watchUrl` logic to handle routing correctly on hot reload refreshes or simply opening the app at a URL that is not the root.\n\
       \n\
       To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).\n\
       \n\
       ## Build for Production\n\
       \n\
       ```sh\n\
       npm run clean\n\
       npm run build\n\
       npm run webpack:production\n\
       ```\n\
       \n\
       This will replace the development artifact `build/Index.js` for an optimized version as well as copy `src/index.html` into `build/`. You can then deploy the contents of the `build` directory (`index.html` and `Index.js`).\n\
       \n\
       If you make use of routing (via `ReasonReact.Router` or similar logic) ensure that server-side routing handles your routes or that 404's are directed back to `index.html` (which is how the dev server is set up).\n\
       \n\
       **To enable dead code elimination**, change `bsconfig.json`'s `package-specs` `module` from `\"commonjs\"` to `\"es6\"`. Then re-run the above 2 commands. This will allow Webpack to remove unused code.\n\
