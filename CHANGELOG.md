- Customization of runtime representation of variants and introduction of untagged variants [PR #6095](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6095), [PR #6103](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6103)

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Add support for uncurried mode: a mode where everything is considered uncurried, whether with or without the `.`. This can be turned on with `@@uncurried` locally in a file. For project-level configuration in `bsconfig.json`, there's a boolean config `"uncurried"`, which propagates to dependencies, to turn on uncurried mode.
Since there's no syntax for partial application in this new mode, introduce `@res.partial foo(x)` to express partial application. This is temporary and will later have some surface syntax.
Make uncurried functions a subtype of curried functions, and allow application for uncurried functions.
The `make` function of components is generated as an uncurried function.
Use best effort to determine the config when formatting a file.
https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5968 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6080 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6086 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6087
- Customization of runtime representation of variants. This is work in progress. E.g. some restrictions on the input. See comments of the form "TODO: put restriction on the variant definitions allowed, to make sure this never happens". https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6095
- Introduce untagged variants https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6103
- Add support for unary uncurried pipe in uncurried mode https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5804
- Add support for partial application of uncurried functions: with uncurried application one can provide a
subset of the arguments, and return a curried type with the remaining ones https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5805
- Add support for uncurried externals https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5815 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5819 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5830 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5894

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- Remove support for the legacy Reason syntax. Existing Reason code can be converted to ReScript syntax using ReScript 9 as follows:
  - `npm i -g rescript@9`
  - `rescript convert <reason files>`
- Remove obsolete built-in project templates and the "rescript init" functionality. This is replaced by [create-rescript-app](https://github.com/rescript-lang/create-rescript-app) which is maintained separately.
- Do not attempt to build ReScript from source on npm postinstall for platforms without prebuilt binaries anymore.
- Made pinned dependencies transitive: if *a* is a pinned dependency of *b* and *b* is a pinned dependency of *c*, then *a* is implicitly a pinned dependency of *c*. This change is only breaking if your build process assumes non-transitivity.
- Curried after uncurried is not fused anymore: `(. x) => y => 3` is not equivalent to `(. x, y) => 3` anymore. It's instead equivalent to `(. x) => { y => 3 }`.
Also, `(. int) => string => bool` is not equivalen to `(. int, string) => bool` anymore.
These are only breaking changes for unformatted code.
- Exponentiation operator `**` is now right-associative. `2. ** 3. ** 2.` now compile to `Math.pow(2, Math.pow(3, 2))` and not anymore `Math.pow(Math.pow(2, 3), 2)`. Parentheses can be used to change precedence.
- Remove unsafe ``` j`$(a)$(b)` ``` interpolation deprecated in compiler version 10 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6068
- Remove deprecated module `Printexc`

- New representation for variants, where the tag is a string instead of a number. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6088
- GenType: removed support for `@genType.as` for records and variants which has become unnecessary. Use the language's `@as` instead to channge the runtime representation without requiring any runtime conversion during FFI. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6099 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6101

# 10.1.3

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Add experimental suppport for directives. An annotation such as `@@directive("use client;")` emits `use client;` verbatim before imports https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5999
- `genType`: add `Core` standard library support for the following builtin types: `Null.t`, `Nullable.t`, `Undefined.t`, `Dict.t<_>`, `Promise.t<_>`, `Date.t`, `BigInt.t`, `RegExp.t`, `Map.t<_, _>`, `WeakMap.t<_, _>`, `Set<_>`, `WeakSet<_>` https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6024

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- `genType`: streamline the treatment of optionals as undefined https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6024
  - Represent `option<t>` as `undefined | t` instead of `null | undefined | t`. This is more permissive when importing functions taking optional values (allows to use option types), but stricter when e.g. exporting ReScript functions taking arguments of option type. Fallback: use `Js.undefined<_>` instead.
  - Represent `{x:option<string>}` as `{x:(undefined | string)}` instead of `{x?: string}`. This is more in line with TS's behaviour. Fallback: use `{x?:string}`.

  - Example: `"suffix": ".bs.js" // determine the suffix`
  - Fix: remove the comment and use standard json.
- Changed return type of `Js.String.match_` as it was wrong. [#5070](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5070)
  - Example: any use of `Js.String.match_` and `Js.String2.match_`
  - Fix: follow the type errors
- GenType is now vendored in the compiler and drops support for the Flow and untyped back-ends to focus on providing a better experience for TypeScript.
  - Fix: keep on using the older version of the compiler and the separate genType package if Flow support is required. Migrate to TS if one wants to upgrade the compiler version.

#### :rocket: New Feature

- New records with optional fields e.g. `type opt = {x: int, y?: string}` were added as an experimental feature [#5423](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5423) [#5452](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/5452) [New Syntax](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/589/files)

- Proper M1 support (CI now supports M1 native builds)

**Syntax**

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- `@bs.send.pipe` is now removed. Earlier it was deprecated.
- Missing labels in function application is now an error (https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/ann-more-strict-checks-in-missed-labels/2117).
  - Example: `let f = (x, ~z) => x + z; f(1, 2)`
  - Fix: do `let f = (x, ~z) => x + z; f(1, ~z=2)` instead
- Externals without `@val` annotations do not work anymore, and externals with `= ""` give an error.
  - Example: `external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` is not supported anymore.
  - Fix: use `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` instead.
  - Example2: `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = ""` is not supported anymore.
  - Fix2: use `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` instead.
- Strings processed at compile-time don't need escaping anymore.
  - Example: `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\\/\\*([^*]|[\\r\\n]|(\\*+([^*/]|[\\r\\n])))*\\*+\\//g")`.
  - Fix: use `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^*/]|[\r\n])))*\*+\//g")` instead.
- Remove parsing of "import" and "export" which was never officially supported https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/597 https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/599
  - Example: `export type t = int`
  - Fix: `@genType type t = int`
  - Example2: `import realValue: complexNumber => float from "./MyMath"`
  - Fix2: `@genType.import("./MyMath") external realValue: complexNumber => float = "realValue"`

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Unicode is now supported in regular strings and chars (when the symbol fits). This is now going to work: `let str = "Σ"`. And, you'll be able to pattern match on unicode chars: `switch c { | 'Σ' => "what a fine unicode char" | _ => "unicode is fun" }`
- Doc comments `/** ... */` are now supported. Inernally, they are attributes, so are only valid at positions where `@foo` is allowed, or a syntax error is given. Similarly for module-level `/*** comments */` that can go where `@@attributes` go.

#### :bug: Bug Fix

  See an exampe of how to [update a ppx](https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/pull/372)
  - Example: for `rescript-relay` 0.23.0 is not supported.
  - Fix: use `rescript-relay@beta` or the new version when released.
- Removed printing modules (Printf, Format etc) and related functions. Details of files added/removed: https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/commit/0fd8bb0e77c4b0e96a9647ac8af614305057003f.

  what ocaml style class is, this should not affect them.

# 9.0.2

- #4990 Fix an optimization bug introduced in 9.0

- #4982 pattern match over modules

Provide user with a sugar to pattern match over modules:

```res
let {length, cons} = module(List)
```

More discussions can be found [here](https://forum.rescript-lang.org/t/introducing-an-extension-to-make-pattern-match-works-on-modules/1196)

# 9.0

- #4933 update syntax bf6561bb5d84
  syntax changes listed [here](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#90)
- #4934 generate `@pure` annotations to help esbuild remove more dead code

- #4932 #4931 turn flow syntax checking from a error into warning 103, so it can be turned off as below

```res
@@config({
  flags: ["-w", "-103"],
})

%%raw(`
if (import.meta.hot){
  console.log('es6')
}
`)
```

The rationale is that flow could be not standard compilant so we need provide a work around, here
`import.meta` is something new in Ecmascript

- #4926 #4928

  for a package, only cmi/cmj artifact changes will trigger a rebuild

# 8.4.1

- Syntax submodule upgrades from 7f5c968 to 7cc70c9
- #4856 #4858
  Improve code generation for pattern match:
  Input:

  ```res
  type t =
    | A
    | B
    | C
    | D (int )
    | E (int)

  let f = x => {
    switch x {
        | A => 0
        | B => 1
        | C => 2
        | D (x) => x
        | E (x) => x + 1
    }
  }
  ```

  Output was:

  ```js
    function f(x) {
      if (typeof x !== "number") {
        if (x.TAG) {
        return x._0 + 1 | 0;
      } else {
        return x._0;
      }

      switch (x) {
        case /* A */0 :
          return 0;
        case /* B */1 :
          return 1;
        case /* C */2 :
          return 2;
    }
  }
  ```

  Now:

  ```js
  function f(x) {
    if (typeof x !== "number") {
      if (x.TAG === /* D */ 0) {
        return x._0;
      } else {
        return (x._0 + 1) | 0;
      }
    }
    switch (x) {
      case /* A */ 0:
        return 0;
      case /* B */ 1:
        return 1;
      case /* C */ 2:
        return 2;
    }
  }
  ```

- No symlink from .bin any more.

  **Old symlinks**:

  ```sh
  tmp > ls -al node_modules/.bin/
  total 96
  drwxr-xr-x  14 hzhang295  staff  476 Sep 20 17:26 .
  drwxr-xr-x   4 hzhang295  staff  136 Sep 20 17:27 ..
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 hzhang295  staff   22 Sep 20 17:26 bsc -> ../bs-platform/bin/bsc
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 hzhang295  staff   25 Sep 20 17:26 bspack -> ../bs-platform/bin/bspack
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 hzhang295  staff   24 Sep 20 17:26 bsppx -> ../bs-platform/bin/bsppx
