#### :rocket: Main New Feature

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Add support for uncurried mode: a mode where everything is considered uncurried, whether with or without the `.`. This can be turned on with `@@uncurried` locally in a file. For project-level configuration in `bsconfig.json`, there's a boolean config `"uncurried"`, which propagates to dependencies, to turn on uncurried mode.
Since there's no syntax for partial application in this new mode, introduce `@res.partial foo(x)` to express partial application. This is temporary and will later have some surface syntax.
Make uncurried functions a subtype of curried functions, and allow application for uncurried functions.
The `make` function of components is generated as an uncurried function.
Use best effort to determine the config when formatting a file.

- Customization of runtime representation of variants. This is work in progress. E.g. some restrictions on the input. See comments of the form "TODO: put restriction on the variant definitions allowed, to make sure this never happens". https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6095
- Introduce untagged variants https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6103
- Add support for unary uncurried pipe in uncurried mode https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5804
- Add support for partial application of uncurried functions: with uncurried application one can provide a
subset of the arguments, and return a curried type with the remaining ones https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5805
- Add support for uncurried externals https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5815 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5819 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5830 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5894
- Parser/Printer: unify uncurried functions of arity 0, and of arity 1 taking unit. There's now only arity 1 in the source language. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5825
- Add support for default arguments in uncurried functions https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5835

- GenType: add support for `@genType` annotations on module definitions. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6113
- Prebuilt binaries are now provided for all major platforms:
  - macOS x64
  - macOS ARM
  - Linux x64 (statically linked)
  - Linux ARM (statically linked)
  - Windows x64

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- Remove support for the legacy Reason syntax. Existing Reason code can be converted to ReScript syntax using ReScript 9 as follows:
  - `npm i -g rescript@9`
  - `rescript convert <reason files>`
- Remove obsolete built-in project templates and the "rescript init" functionality. This is replaced by [create-rescript-app](https://github.com/rescript-lang/create-rescript-app) which is maintained separately.
- Do not attempt to build ReScript from source on npm postinstall for platforms without prebuilt binaries anymore.
- Made pinned dependencies transitive: if *a* is a pinned dependency of *b* and *b* is a pinned dependency of *c*, then *a* is implicitly a pinned dependency of *c*. This change is only breaking if your build process assumes non-transitivity.
- Curried after uncurried is not fused anymore: `(. x) => y => 3` is not equivalent to `(. x, y) => 3` anymore. It's instead equivalent to `(. x) => { y => 3 }`.
Also, `(. int) => string => bool` is not equivalen to `(. int, string) => bool` anymore.
These are only breaking changes for unformatted code.
- Exponentiation operator `**` is now right-associative. `2. ** 3. ** 2.` now compile to `Math.pow(2, Math.pow(3, 2))` and not anymore `Math.pow(Math.pow(2, 3), 2)`. Parentheses can be used to change precedence.
- Remove unsafe ``` j`$(a)$(b)` ``` interpolation deprecated in compiler version 10 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6068
- Remove deprecated module `Printexc`
- `@deriving(jsConverter)` not supported anymore for variant types https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6088
- New representation for variants, where the tag is a string instead of a number. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6088
- GenType: removed support for `@genType.as` for records and variants which has become unnecessary. Use the language's `@as` instead to channge the runtime representation without requiring any runtime conversion during FFI. https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6099 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6101

# 10.1.3

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Add experimental suppport for directives. An annotation such as `@@directive("use client;")` emits `use client;` verbatim before imports https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5999
- `genType`: add `Core` standard library support for the following builtin types: `Null.t`, `Nullable.t`, `Undefined.t`, `Dict.t<_>`, `Promise.t<_>`, `Date.t`, `BigInt.t`, `RegExp.t`, `Map.t<_, _>`, `WeakMap.t<_, _>`, `Set<_>`, `WeakSet<_>` https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6024

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- `genType`: streamline the treatment of optionals as undefined https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/6024
  - Represent `option<t>` as `undefined | t` instead of `null | undefined | t`. This is more permissive when importing functions taking optional values (allows to use option types), but stricter when e.g. exporting ReScript functions taking arguments of option type. Fallback: use `Js.undefined<_>` instead.
  - Represent `{x:option<string>}` as `{x:(undefined | string)}` instead of `{x?: string}`. This is more in line with TS's behaviour. Fallback: use `{x?:string}`.

  - Fix2: use `@val external setTimeout: (unit => unit, int) => float = "setTimeout"` instead.
- Strings processed at compile-time don't need escaping anymore.
  - Example: `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\\/\\*([^*]|[\\r\\n]|(\\*+([^*/]|[\\r\\n])))*\\*+\\//g")`.
  - Fix: use `let blockCommentsRe = %re("/\/\*([^*]|[\r\n]|(\*+([^*/]|[\r\n])))*\*+\//g")` instead.
- Remove parsing of "import" and "export" which was never officially supported https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/597 https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/599
  - Example: `export type t = int`
  - Fix: `@genType type t = int`
  - Example2: `import realValue: complexNumber => float from "./MyMath"`
  - Fix2: `@genType.import("./MyMath") external realValue: complexNumber => float = "realValue"`

#### :rocket: New Feature

- Unicode is now supported in regular strings and chars (when the symbol fits). This is now going to work: `let str = "Σ"`. And, you'll be able to pattern match on unicode chars: `switch c { | 'Σ' => "what a fine unicode char" | _ => "unicode is fun" }`
- Doc comments `/** ... */` are now supported. Inernally, they are attributes, so are only valid at positions where `@foo` is allowed, or a syntax error is given. Similarly for module-level `/*** comments */` that can go where `@@attributes` go.

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Fix printing for inline nullary functor types [#477](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/477)
- Fix stripping of quotes for empty poly variants [#474](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/474)
- Implement syntax for arity zero vs arity one in uncurried application in [#139](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/139)
- Fix parsing of first class module exprs as part of binary/ternary expr in [#256](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/pull/256)
- Fix formatter hanging on deeply nested function calls [#261](https://github.com/rescript-lang/syntax/issues/261)

**Libraries**

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- **"Attributes not allowed here"**. If you see this error chances are you're using a ppx that needs updating to a new version.
  See an exampe of how to [update a ppx](https://github.com/zth/rescript-relay/pull/372)
  - Example: for `rescript-relay` 0.23.0 is not supported.
  - Fix: use `rescript-relay@beta` or the new version when released.
- Removed printing modules (Printf, Format etc) and related functions. Details of files added/removed: https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/commit/0fd8bb0e77c4b0e96a9647ac8af614305057003f.

#### :bug: Bug Fix

- Fix library issue with missing `bytes_to_string` https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/5573 https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5589

#### :nail_care: Polish

- Several Belt / Js libraries are now converted to ReScript syntax, with corresponding comments in Markdown format suitable for hovering. See [#5361](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5361).

**Playground**

#### :house: Internal

- Added `jsoo_playground_main.ml` as the rescript-lang.org playground bundle entrypoint

#### :boom: Breaking Change

- Removed Reason syntax support for the playground experience. See https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/pull/5375
