  Array's `...` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: such spread would create a subarray; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
Solution: if it's to validate the first few elements, use a `when` clause + Array size check + `get` checks on the current pattern. If it's to obtain a subarray, use `Array.sub` or `Belt.Array.slice`.
