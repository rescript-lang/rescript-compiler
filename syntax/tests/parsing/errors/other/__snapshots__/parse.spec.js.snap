Arrays can't use the \`...\` spread currently. Please use \`concat\` or other Array helpers.

Array's \`...\` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: such spread would create a subarray; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
Solution: if it's to validate the first few elements, use a \`when\` clause + Array size check + \`get\` checks on the current pattern. If it's to obtain a subarray, use \`Array.sub\` or \`Belt.Array.slice\`.

Records can only have one \`...\` spread, at the beginning.
Explanation: since records have a known, fixed shape, a spread like \`{a, ...b}\` wouldn't make sense, as \`b\` would override every field of \`a\` anyway.

Record's \`...\` spread is not supported in pattern matches.
Explanation: you can't collect a subset of a record's field into its own record, since a record needs an explicit declaration and that subset wouldn't have one.
Solution: you need to pull out each field you want explicitly.

List pattern matches only supports one \`...\` spread, at the end.
Explanation: a list spread at the tail is efficient, but a spread in the middle would create new list[s]; out of performance concern, our pattern matching currently guarantees to never create new intermediate data.
